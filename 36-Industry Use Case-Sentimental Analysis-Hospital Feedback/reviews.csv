Hareem James,"The office is very clean. The staff is very friendly and I was seen in a timely manner. The nurse practitioner, Stephanie that saw me was kind and very helpful. She answered listened to all my concerns and answered all the questions I had.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Yolanda Christie,Everyone is so nice and caring. I had 2 horrible experiences with 2 other doctors offices so I was really scared but they treated me with kindness and they were very gentle. Love this place.,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Tammy Schmidt,"Dr Valenzuela is amazing, I highly recommend her. She made me feel comfortable and gave me honest feedback when other doctors in the past gave me the run around or not enough information. I've mainly been to the Chino Hills location , the entire staff has been friendly since day 1!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Jensen Arnold,"I HATE THIS PLACE. Â I really do. The facility is nice, and they're able to get you in in a timely fashion. Â The staff is nice.. Those are the pros.The receptionist had my insurance information but wanted to see the physical card rather than actually just verifying my name. She has more information about my insurance than my insurance card would have had. Asked my husband to email the card while I was there: it was in vein. I was there to remove an arm implant for birth control. They wanted a urine sample to determine if I was pregnant. They never told me they needed a sample.. I just voided my bladder 10 minutes prior. What's the point? I'm here to REMOVE BC. If I was pregnant were they going to leave it in my arm? Of course not. If I'm not pregnant, you're still going to remove it. Just say you want a reason to bill my insurance for extra items. I would have respected that. Then their consent form that clearly no one reads, including them. I disagreed because I didn't want to be video taped or photographed. One of the Dr's said I don't have permission to record in the office. I told her that's NOT at all what this says. It said ""I agree to be video taped, photographed or filmed...."" Â this is the 3rd and final time I'm dealing with their incompetence.*previous appointment was they needed to test my breast milk. The sample collected was insufficient and I never received the results I needed. That was a waste of time, breast milk, and lab testing. *** 1st appointment with them was when I was pregnant. I had several questions. They were giving me answers, but not answering my questions. I even re-worded my questions, and she would say the same thing. Â I immediately left and found a midwife for my prenatal care.I don't need nice staff if you're unable to address my concerns and questions to my satisfaction about my health. At this point I wouldn't trust them with a mosquitoe bite.",1,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Indigo Bate,I am currently 32 Â weeks pregnant. My husband and I switched to Care for Women after moving to the area. I was already half way through my pregnancy. I have been seen by Dr. Vu for all my appointments so far. She is always so positive. She is very attentive and not in any rush. She answers any questions that I had and makes sure to ease any concerns I had.,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Zahra Levine,"I was checked out NP Cynthia Raymond &amp; a student (didnt get a name) and they were both angels! They made me feel very comfortable and seen, especially for my first time going. I voiced my concerns or any questions I had and Raymond didn't hesitate to answer or make me feel dumb about it at all! They were the best experiences i've had with any doctor.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Abigayle Washington,"Not the best experience. Called them ten times and no answer. When i got my appointment, it was 30 minutes waiting for less than five minutes with the doctor.",2,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Betsy Rios,Great service from checking in to follow up calls. I appreciate the gentle warmth during such a heart breaking season. Thank you for your kindness and time. I didn't feel rushed at my appointment or on my follow up call. Blessings to the staff and medical providers.,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Marwan Velazquez,Almost no wait time! Incredible! Unheard of any place else. Love meeting my new Obgyn. Their staff is very professional and can be friendly. Thanks for the good first impression.,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Lucian Hagan,"I've been to this facility several times, all have been fantastic. I wanted to give a shout-out to Lori for all of the care she's given me over the past several months.I got an IUD at this facility and had an anxiety attack prior to the procedure - with severe anxiety disorder, I don't do well with change, and came into this office in shambles. Lori was extremely patient and comforting, throughly walking through all of the steps and benefits from this procedure. She took the time to listen to my concerns and provided a logical and empathetic response. I was the last appointment of the day, and drove myself there. She offered to help me get home if I wasn't feeling well post-procedure. It's obvious that she cares about me/her patients and I hope I can continue to see her for years to come. Big thank you to Lori for being awesome and for the front desk staff for being so thorough and timely.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Summer-Louise Arroyo,"On balance, this seems to me to be a better way to deliver primary care for several reasons:1. Â appointment and wait times. Â A pet peeve of mine is that a very common experience is to wait for a half hour or more past your appointment time, even though one might make a special effort, as I do, to arrive 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time. Â At the Americana location, I arrived a little over 10 minutes before the appointment, signed in, and was immediately welcomed and checked in.2. Â As with any physician's office, a technician will get some minimal basic information (weight, temperature, pulse, O2 sat.) Â Well, that last one is kinda newish, but standard now in the age of the corona virus. Â They have a fancy kind of gimmicky way of doing that (there's a smartscreen that takes your temp, an electronic scale, and a built-in pulse oximeter, but whatever, it works, and links to your file).3. Â You're taken to an exam room next, where this visit a very skilled (always appreciated) phlebotomist did a blood draw and BP. Â And pulse ox because the fancy gizmo didn't work because my hands were cold from walking from the parking garage. Â The exam room is nice, because it's set up like a comfortable office, not the usual 1960's vibe stainless steel and black pleather look that somehow became the standard.4. Â The killer big screen is kind of a gimmick, but was cool because it did allow Â a more direct interaction with the doctor, without the distracted mediation of the now-ubiquitous iPad. Â So, good on Forward for that.5. Â The interaction with the doctor (I think it was like his first day at Forward, but he was cool) was great. Â Good questions about ""wellness"", and because of my age, a check for esophageal cancer signs/symptoms (he was cool, and didn't let on that was what he was looking for, so, fine.)Big plusses are we got ""quick"" bloodwork results during the visit. Â Great to discuss while everything was fresh, and when the glucose level looked a little high, he sent out to Quest for a more accurate test. Â The most amazing part? Â I got an update on that ON THE APP later that day. Â I can't say how much better it is to have that level of transparency and immediate feedback.Well, from the length of this review you can tell that I'm positive about Forward, and look forward (heh) to seeing how it goes for the next year or so. Â I have high expectations, and hope that this does indeed live Â up to its promise as a better way to deliver primary care both for patients and physicians.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Chandni Searle,"I have had many, and i mean many doctors over the past decade. I have never ever received the personalized attention and care as the one I received in my first baseline visit! I was super blown away by the flexibility and the in depth assistance! So efficient, they immediately had results and my assigned doctor, Dr. Tully was informative and caring. Post visit, the app is incredible. You can access results of all tests and can make appointments easily. They have care team online to respond via chat 24hr. They are SO helpful and full of resources. I just got my fiancÃ© to sign up as well as the advantages and benefits are incomparable! Hands down the best doctor experience I've had.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Klara Winters,"I had a great first baseline visit and was impressed with the amount of time and attention I received. Â Place was clean, I was the only patient scheduled so the Covid risk seemed minimal, all staff were dressed with layers of PPE, I was bedazzled by the equipment, and my assigned doctor, Dr Becketti seemed competent and caring, giving me 45 minutes of undivided attention. Â I got quick responses from my updates through the APP. Â I don't know if I'm speaking too soon, since I read some of the one-star ratings, but so far Forward has exceeded my expectations",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Lylah Simmons,The staff at the location are really nice and helpful. Even the doctors are great when you actually see them.My issue with them is their App and the service they provide. Their failure to help me secure my medication took over a week and require my constantly following up to make sure it took place.Someone will say they'll send thru a prescription but then you call pharmacy and they don't have it. This went on for DAYS. Â Don't waste your money here. I'm looking into other options like One Medical.,1,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Jun Acevedo,"My baseline visit was great. Â Dr. Lam was warm, engaged, attentive, and informative. Â I am delighted to be working with him and at Forward.Donna P",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Inigo Kennedy,"I have been floored by the care I have received in just my first 2 visits at Forward in Glendale. Â The care team from reception to the doctors all expressed genuinet joy in being in the business of taking care of people's health. Â From a technology and speed point, Forward is the leading edge offering testing onsite and displayed on touch screens that make it easy to digest and are visually stunning. Â I can't speak highly enough about Dr. Becketti. Â Many thanks to the entire team. I can't recommend Forward Health enough!",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Emyr Mair,"I am not a review leaver, but I tried Forward on a whim and am so glad I have them. I use my HSA to pay for it and it is the best doctor experience I've ever had. Also they just go the extra mile to be sort of a health ""assistant"" which is really worth it.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Abdullah Burns,"Why Forward is so afraid of you reading honest feedback is what you should wonder. This review was flagged and removed and since Forward has a very efficient ""social media team"", they managed to rip down my reviews of them and I have been asked to elaborate further for the reviews to stay. So here it goes....My ONE star review still stands, and I hope this company don't have magic powers to falsely remove everything negative about them with contacts ""higher up"". They are a perfect example of a medical practice built by excellent marketers with a complete lack of customer service skills. Take your money and run mentality.I saw their ads everywhere, I got their pamphlet in the mail... I spoke to their scripted salesperson who sounded very much like a scary car-salesman who tried to dodge every one of my questions with canned responses.When speaking to their sales team I continuously asked why I would need Forward when I have PPO and a GP already and all I got was non-specified answers.After trying to push for answers several times about what the membership was actually worth for me the salesperson quickly just turned around and said:""It sounds to me that Forward is not the best solution for you at the moment. It was a pleasure speaking with you and sorry for taking up your time"".So, they don't want you to ask questions. They don't want to give you any real straight answers. And if you push for answers, they hang up. Just like one of those robocallers who light up your phone every day.This is not the solution to health care....This is the usual tech-startup charlatans with a sexy webpage, aggressive Facebook / Instagram advertising and canned response sales scripts. They are waiting to grab your money for nothing else than digital snake oil in return.Like many others, these guys will not be around for more than a couple of years.....",1,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Jamelia Gonzales,I've been going to forward for a couple months and love it so far. It's so convenient. I can get fast covid tests and antibody tests. I was having skin issues and they were able to diagnosis me on the app and send me prescriptions that way. Very personalized care. This is honestly how medicine should be.,5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Murtaza Sheehan,"Ok. I see that others have had a positive experience with this company - but we have not! Â WE HAVE MORE THAN HAD IT WITH WHAT WE CAN ONLY ASSUME IS Total INCOMPETENCE. We have tried to contact Forward for 6 months to follow up up on my husband's one and only visit to the Glendale office. At the appointment, their single most important measurement machine WAS NOT WORKING so he did not get the info he signed up and went there in the first place. They never bothered to contact us - and we cannot contact them DIRECTLY because the company can be reached ONLY through a buggy app that DOES NOT WORK FOR US though we downloaded it directly from them; their phone number is NEVER answered. We have phoned and phoned - leaving numerous messages to say that we need their help using their app so we can follow up to get the assessment my husband most needs. After each request for help there is a MESSAGE back saying they called back and left a message, which cannot be: They have two CEL numbers and our land line and there is no record of an incoming call from Forward EVER and our email address - all of which was filled out in detail in the treatment application papers. We signed a six-month contract to pay $149 a month for their 'caring services and personal attention.' Accordingly, my husband has been charged $149 every month FOR NO SERVICE AT ALL. This includes the first visit when their 'machine is broken.' Forward has nullified the contract by failing to provide the service they promised to provide. We have been more than patient with them. I am prepared now to go to file a complaint with the California Consumer Protection Agency for return of the fees we have been charged, report them to the BBB, and anywhere else I can go to file a complaint and perhaps a lawsuit against Forward. I expect that they will answer my review saying that they tried calling us back and left messages. PLEASE KNOW IN ADVANCE YELPERS THAT THEIR ASSERTIONS ARE UNTRUE!",1,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Carys Pugh,"If your anything like me you never wanna go for a check up but for the past 5 years dr Andreh Carapiet is the best , he actually cares about his patients and takes the time to listen He will never push you to take medications or do things you will not be happy doing he will listen and give his professional advice and help you come out with a plan to make you feel better and get to goals you have as far as health goes I definitely would recommend him to all my family and friendsI can not forget about the staff they are so personal and helpful with everything thank you",5,Elevate Health Group,"Internal Medicine, IV Hydration, Urgent Care"
Mikael Truong,"Dr Garen and the Elevate Health Group are absolutely exceptional. I felt immediately welcome by Ana after entering who was super helpful in getting me setup. Â She was knowledgeable and even notified me of parking behind the facility so I didn't have to pay for the meter! Serj was down to earth and personable. He did a fantastic job of getting me into my screening room where I felt comfortable and excited to meet the Dr (which is a first for me). Dr Garen was amazing. He clearly went over everything we wanted to check to make sure my health was in the most amazing shape possible and did an great job talking me through each physical check he was making and why. That level of transparency made me feel super comfortable and when we took my blood pressure the second time, I was way more relaxed and at ease. Rounding off the team was Valentina. It's clear she is there to make the patients feel comfortable with returning because that's exactly what I plan to do. Even through a mask she was charming and funny, and I appreciate how open she was to just make me and every guest there as comfortable as possible. It didn't end with just the few i mentioned, everyone there is was like a well oiled machine helping each other. You can see and feel the team chemistry and connection. If you are looking for a great doctor, engaging team, and modern tech in a clean environment, Elevate Health Group Glendale is the place to be!!",5,Elevate Health Group,"Internal Medicine, IV Hydration, Urgent Care"
Joel Suarez,"Honestly, I was very surprised to find health care providers, especially in Glendale, to be so professional and considerate! I am definitely one of those patients that likes to ask several questions beforehand, and the staff was extremely patient and forthcoming with me, throughout ALLLLL of my inquiries. When I arrived, I was very kindly greeted by the receptionist, and filled out my paperwork. Initially, I was a bit nervous when I saw the number of people waiting in the waiting room, because I just assumed I would be waiting for a lot longer past my appointment time, given my past experiences with other healthcare providers. To my surprise, very shortly after submitting my initial paperwork, I was called back into the evaluation rooms. I was immediately attended to by the nurse, and then within moments, the doctor arrived. Dr. Arazin Minasian was very knowledgable and competent. Â He was diligent and ensured that all my concerns were acknwoledged.Everyone was so professional and helpful. This place is very clean, up-to-date and current, with very knowledgeable staff. Importantly, they DO NOT unnecessarily keep you in the waiting room for hours to be seen (pet peeve). Â They ensure that you are scene shortly after your check-in time. Â I highly recommend anyone looking for new healthcare professionals to check this place out. Thank you, Elevate!",5,Elevate Health Group,"Internal Medicine, IV Hydration, Urgent Care"

Harmony House,"I have battled with finding a good doctor and good office staff for a primary care physician for years. Just when I thought I had found one, my doctor left the state and closed his practice. I didn't know what to do. So, I started my research process. A friend recommended Elevate. I did a little more research and loved their new facility. State of the art, new technology driven sign-up, portal, and get this, a human picks up my phone call! Ha! I was sold. I did research on the multiple providers I could see, and finally choose one, Dr. Carapeit. Dr. Carapeit was amazing and answered all my questions and reviewed labs in detail. I love working in the portal system because I can email my doctor anytime and I get a quick reply. Besides the doctors, the nursing staff is amazing. My favorite nurse, nurse Alina always takes good care of me during my visit. She has been so nice to me, and so sweet. The world should have more nurses who care for their patients, just like Nurse Alina. This place is a one stop shop wellness center. I've even tried their ivy therapy when I wasn't feeling well and it honesty saved the day. Scheduling the ivy therapy was easy as well. I'm so tired of ""press option 2 for blah blah blah"". I finally have an office that has real kind people to speak with and a doctor and nurse staff that is exceptional. If you're in the market for a new wellness center and physician, just call elevate. Trust me!",5,Elevate Health Group,"Internal Medicine, IV Hydration, Urgent Care"
Malachy Mckinney,"I've been seen at Elevate Health Group a few times now and I've have had only the best experiences. My work requires clearance notes and insurance audits for days off and they have delivered timely and efficiently to not cause any issues with my employer. I was so impressed with their new facility, staff and organization. Given covid times there's plenty of space and proper precautions taken. Ive always been brought into my appointment right on time and had the best experiences with Dr. Tovmassian. Takes his time and makes sure you leave taken care of. My lab work has been done same day painlessly which is a huge plus! Also, found out they have x-ray in office as well as IV vitamin infusions. Very convenient.

Daisy-May Woodcock,"I had a Â surgical procedure scheduled for 2/17. I contacted Elevate and let them know I had all of my labs done and I needed clearance from a doctor to Â fax to my surgeons office. They assured me it was no issue and they could easily take care of it for me and scheduled me to come in for their next available appt.The office is very lovely and the doctor that I saw was incredibly nice. I regrettably had an issue with the front desk however once she was made aware of it the manager, Katia, went above and beyond to apologize and quickly resolve it. I understand that in business sometimes mistakes happen and how we choose to deal with them is what's important. Thank you Elevate for a positive experience!

Neal Montes,"My experience at the Carbon Health clinic itself was very good when it came to the medical staff, who were professional and friendly. Â However, I cannot say the same for the front of office people. I came to the clinic to get a COVID test, which was required by my doctor prior to a medical procedure. I filled out and signed a release form for my test result to be sent to my doctor's office in order to be cleared for the procedure to go forward as was scheduled (in less than a week's time.). My doctor never heard from Carbon, so I had to spend time tracking things down between the parties, finally getting Carbon to send the result to my doctor. This isn't the sort of thing for a medical facility to be negligent about. Again, good medical staff. Front office, not so good.",2,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Juanita Scott,"Cool concept, very poor execution. Services went fine, but they are greedy and will attempt to bill you twice like they are currently doing to me.

Scammy practice.",1,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Elouise Sanderson,"It was my first time going to Carbon Health and I am pleasantly surprised. I absolutely hate making doctors appointments, and haven't had a yearly exam for over 10yrs. I didn't have high hopes coming here, but decided to give it a try after spending hours looking through my providers list. Making an appointment was really easy, you don't have to deal with phone calls, just a quick booking through the app and your done, it is very convenient, quick and easy. Walking through the door you automatically feel welcomed, everyone is super nice and helpful. I went for a yearly exam with Dr. Neeru Singh and she was very knowledgeable, and attentive. Despite the fact that they were running behind on some appointments due to power outages, I never felt rushed. One thing I think they could improve on is making the location easier to find, it's on the side of a building and kind of hidden (trees). Some signs up front on Pacific Ave pointing to where you need to go would be nice. I got lost looking for the location and almost went the wrong way. Overall I am pleased and would definitely comeback, I would recommend.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Wojciech Bender,"Avoid using Carbon Health if you want to prevent surprise bills after your visit.I booked an appointment with Carbon (SF) for a routine physical exam. In order to make sure that my lab tests will be fully covered. I confirmed with the receptionist as well as the nurse that my lab tests would be 100% covered as they come under preventive care. But to my surprise, I received a 60$ bill from Quest Labs for some tests that I did not even ask for. Upon contacting the billing department at Carbon, I was told that since some tests were not available at Carbon they sent it to Quest Labs that charged me this bill for a simple lab test which is usually free of cost.

Colin Ewing,"Easily the worst experience I've had with a doctor. The scheduling part is great - the app is easy to use and getting the appointment wasn't the problem. But don't go here if you want a doctor that cares. The clinician was extremely dispassionate, told me that what I had originally come in for was incorrect but did not proceed to tell me anything else that could help the diagnosis. Just gave me the most generic answer that I could have found on Google. Wouldn't run any other tests. I felt incredibly bad speaking with her, she made me feel worse, and I left almost in tears. They said they would refer me to a specialist but they don't even check which specialists are open and the lady at the front desk had no idea that she had to refer me.",1,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Easy to talk with and with the easy to use application, great to see my testing results.Then came the moment where they really shined, when away on an international trip, with a few hours before a scuba trip, Dr Burrell was quick to respond in a matter of hours (after business hours) to get me the needed medical clearance for the trip.

Omer Cabrera,"Created an account just to write a review.Yikes. Between a delay on submitting to insurance, an awkward interaction in the room, taking care of the patient, and just general courtesy, save your time and money and go somewhere else.Let's start at the beginning: Walked in and checked in all fine and dandy. A nurse came out to get me to do the basics on getting my vitals and asking about shots which I agreed to getting (more on that later). The nurse felt almost unsure of herself in what she was doing which you can only imagine what it made me feel. After that, Mr. Burrell came into the room and let me tell you, it was one of the most distant, disconnected, and uninteresting conversations I've ever had with a doctor. I felt like instead of wanting to get to know me and my habits to better evaluate my health, the questions had a feel of ""this-is-what-I-learned-to-ask-in-medical-school-and-I-won't-deviate."" The discussion was so shallow, I feel like I got absolutely nothing out of it. Nothing.After a less than stellar interaction with the doc, the nurse came back in to do the shots. Usually nurses ask if you're right- or left-hand dominant and do the shot in the opposite arm so you can write and go on about your life with minimal impact. Well, not this time. I'm left-handed but thank you for assuming that I'm right-handed like the majority of the world. I wasn't able to write let alone type for a day and a half. Wonderful...As if that wasn't already enough, once the appointment was over (finally) the nurse had left the room with not so much as waiting for me to gather my things or AT LEAST giving directions to the exit. So I spent a good few minutes wandering around the office until I found the exit. It's such a small thing but it greatly impacts the appointment.The next part is my partially bad and I 100% take accountability for my side of it. Because I got NOTHING from this interaction, I decided to go elsewhere for checkups. However, because Carbon is so slow, the other office submitted their claim first and thus got the insurance. I find a nice little invoice from Carbon saying that I'm being charged $200. Okay, I understand if it isn't covered by insurance it's $200 and I wouldn't be mad if I actually got something out of it. However, as stated earlier, I didn't get anything out of if and now I'm stuck for paying $200 for one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a doctor's office.Wow, wow, wow.",1,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Fionnuala Mackay,"I was seen on 2/25/2020 after experiencing dizziness and not feeling well in a manner that I just could not really describe. What I was going through sort of came in waves of feeling ok and then feeling strange with my heart racing/pounding, dizziness and temporal head pain. The LVN, Louise was absolutely amazing in her awareness that she knew something was just not right. She did everything she could to ensure that I was as comfortable as possible. She was sweet and nurturing. She consulted with the clinician, Esther who was equally as wonderful in ensuring I was comfortable, while keeping me calm. They both showed compassion and concern for my well being, they were also calm in their demeanor, which helped me do my best to remain calm, while my blood pressure readings were all over the map. Dr. Caesar Djavaherian monitored me for approximately an hour. During that time, he was absolutely amazing in his kindness, attentiveness and medical decision making. He ran all of the tests that are available within the scope of an urgent care clinic and then recommended that I go to an ER. He talked with me about the pros and cons of going or not going to the ER and together we made the decision that it was better for my safety to go to the ER. I can not say enough good things about the team at Carbon Health that consulted together and demonstrated true teamwork to ensure that my safety mattered more than anything else. THANK YOU to Louise, Esther and Dr. Djavaherian for being so compassionate in providing such amazing care!",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Jarrad Morley,"I never thought I could a visit to urgent care, but My experience here was just fabulous! I made an appointment after a flare up of some chronic post surgery knee pain that was preventing me from walking. Not only was the appointment extremely easy to make, the online paperwork and questionnaire were so simple. On day of my appointment ( next day btw) I got right in, and the doctor was already up to speed on my problem. He asked a few relevant questions gave me some real useful and non judgmental advice and recommended me to an ortho doctor. I made an appointment at the Ortho for that afternoon and the ortho doctor treated the micro fascia around my knees and like magic I can stand and bend without pain. Dr EJ and Fletcher, you guys have changed my life. I am going to be a happier healthier person because of your amazing care, Thank you!! I have always felt like medicine in the US was horrible for actual preventive care but not here. I can not recommend this place enough.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Teodor Hodges,"Da best! Thank you Carbon Health for everything. 5 star experience: ease of booking, office staff, follow up before and after appointment, Dr. Burrell!, communications, referrals to other doctors.Really made healthcare enjoyable and felt like I was in great hands.

And plan to see him whenever needed going forward :)Thank you!",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Alfie-Jay Harmon,"Between the incorrect referrals, the long response times, and the sour attitudes, dealing with Carbon had been a nightmare.

Matthew Marquez,"be mindful of what the patient needs and their situation, needed a referral for an xray for a possible broken foot, and they made me go all the way to their office for a consultation just to get the referral, went to a consultation room and was asked a bunch of questions irrelevant to the reason i went there, then I get the wrong referral! I try contacting them through the app and calling the office and nothing, then when finally a person answers the phone, she had an attitude! very unprofessional! that's not the way to handle an angry customer that you just wasted her time and made her walk on an injured foot to an imaging facility ""nearby"" that has a broken xray machine!!! very very disappointed in your services. no one even apologized for the mistakes! And it is not the first time they show poor customer service!",1,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Niamh Whittaker,This is probably the most painless experience with a doctor's office I have ever had.We were done with a routine physical in well under an hour. Dr. Burrell was great and went over all the major potential risk factors for me. Felt like I got a full work up personalized to me. Had to come back to do a blood test after I had fasted and they didn't even need me to make an appointment. I just walked right in to get the work done. I would HIGHLY recommend Carbon Health if you are looking for a physician.,5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Mae Bone,Finally healthcare that has joined the 21st century. I just had my first appointment here and I loved it! Everything was streamlined before the appointment making check in a breeze. I never sat alone in the room for than a minute alone and Dr. Sadarangani was extremely polite and professional.,5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Kien Feeney,I was so happy to realize that I could have all of my medical needs met by Carbon.

Bobby Hassan,Nice concept but way too inefficient. Booked appointment at 12 but had to wait 30 mins for my turn. Was left in the room for another 20 minutes while nurse went to get results for my test. Doctor was kinda indifferent and wasn't super helpful.,3,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Sachin Fletcher,"I had a great experience with all of the doctors and nurses at Carbon Health. Being able to communicate directly with the doctor (like a text chain), schedule a same day appointment, track my prescriptions, and more through their app was convenient and easy.I went to my appointment, got my prescription, and was able to communicate my progress with Dr Burrell directly through the app instead of having to schedule another appointment. Saved me a ton of time and actually got me to follow up with the doctor because it was not such a hassle!Looking forward to having Carbon be my primary care physician.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Richard Lambert,"The best doctor experience I've ever had.I have been using Carbon for a few months now and it is the best!! Why? I can see everything on the app; my treatment plans, prescriptions, lab results, follow ups. I can also text my doctor if I have a question or when I am not sure whether it is worth to a trip to office. When I had to go to office, it wasn't like any other doctor office experiences. I didn't need to fill any paper forms, wait for minutes to see the doctor and explain the same things to two other people before I finally saw my doctor. The doctor answered all my questions and never seemed like he was in rush. And when I was done, everything was on the app.I highly recommend Carbon if you want to have an amazing, high-tech doctor experience. I wish all my specialists use Carbon app..:)",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Opal Martinez,"Carbon Health is amazing! I've used their app many times to talk with their doctors, and have been to the clinic as well. All of my experiences with their team have been fantastic! The biggest difference between their clinic and others I've been to is that it's truly centered around you. You can chat with their doctors through their app (I also heard you can do video calls, although I have not used that), and only need to go into the clinic when it's really necessary, which is super helpful and very convenient for working with your schedule. The doctors are really on top of following up with you, and all of my info is stored directly in the app which means I can always access it (helpful for showing other doctors, etc). Overall both the in-person and in-app experiences are really highly recommended.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Larissa Ratcliffe,"NP. McKoy is amazing! She really took the time to listen to my needs, had a very calming presence and gave me very thorough feedback and suggestions. I feel like I can go to her if I think of any questions later and will definitely be back and tell my friends!",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Dua Bentley,"I work for a tech startup and always wondered why doctors were so far behind in technology. After downloading the Carbon app from itunes I was able to quickly signup and book an appointment. No phone calls with the reception and when I arrived there were no paper forms to fill out!The office is the nicest doctors office I've been to. Everything is new and modern. Dr greg was a great doctor. My previous doctor was always late to my appointments and seemed like he was in a rush. Very different experience with Dr Greg. After my appointment, everything was available in the app including my prescription. Finally, a doctor with cool technology! Highly recommend.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Very modern and very efficient, definitely coming here from now on.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Alistair Moses,"This clinic is fantastic, I've made several visits already and whoever I've come across were awesome. I had an accident and had injuries to my leg and arm and Tatiana (she is a nurse) took a great care of wounds and applying antibiotic creams. The whole process was smooth and could be more painful if she was not that caring and experienced. Their app is really helpful and handy for making appointments and chats with your doctor and staff. This is my to-go clinic in SF. I highly recommend this clinic.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Kevin Irvine,"Everything abut my first appointment at CH yesterday was great. SO much better than the clinics and doctors I had been seeing. CH staff, nurses, and Dr. Burrell were all genuinely friendly, helpful, and responsive to my questions and concerns. I also very much like the app and fast and complete digital communication. Finally, the short walk from Embarcadero BART was easy and pleasant. I'm delighted to have found CH.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Abdur-Rahman Fenton,"The staff at Carbon Health make scheduling and communicating with your doctor so much easier. The app allows you to schedule an appointment, communication with your doctor and even view lab results all on your phone!My experience at the office was great and they make it very easy to not only see a doctor but also they will conduct any lab draws in-office without having to go offsite to another facility. Dr. Burrell and Elizabeth are very through and take the time to meet with you. Louise their LVN is very welcoming and makes the whole process very painless.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Brenden Steadman,"My doctor's appointment with Dr. Burrell, by far, has been the BEST experience ever. Â He reviewed my medical history, any existing issues, and recommended next steps.

Alton Gallegos,"Favorite doctors office by far. The app was dope and allowed me to handle everything with my phone, from scheduling to messaging the office to getting scrips delivered. Super convenient way for a busy professional to see the doctor when needed. And Dr Burrell was the man and made sure he answered all of my questions. Everyone should visit if they want an easier doctors office experience",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Caolan Ramsay,"I saw the reply from this office so here's my response to that. Â The request was sent to your office early Friday. Tuesday late afternoon is not 48 hours. And that was after I kept calling and sending messages on your app. Â Additionally, it's also how RUDE some of the people in your office are over the phone. ""I don't know"" ""I don't know"" ""I don't know"" is pretty much what everyone at your office seems to say every time I call to ask for help. Basically I don't want to go and find out and deal with it so leave me alone attitude. And this wasn't the first time. _____________________________________________________I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed with my experience with Elizabeth and Dr. Burrell. I had to interact with them both twice at Carbon. And both times, it was clear that she was not the right nurse for me or the right doctor for that matter. Elizabeth doesn't communicate well, isn't a very good listener and does not respond to messages sent through the app. In fact, she recommended some testing during my first visit and when I needed the prescription, she asked me a bunch of questions which I answered, and then she just went dark on me without a reply. After calling the office a number of times, I was told I'd get it taken care of today. Waited all day and it didn't happen. Called back and then I was told I'd get a response from her. Her response? I'm busy and I need to look at the chart. That's AFTER waiting all day for her already. I understand you're busy. Everyone is busy if you work full-time . This was a very basic request but apparently she's too busy to even spend 5-10 mins to help a patient out. Additionally, Burrell is apparently too busy, so busy in fact that OptumRX has put in the mail order request for the scripts on FRIDAY and as of TUESDAY, nobody had responded to them. When I called the office, apparently nobody can do anything until the doctor responds. This place is definitely the worst medical office I've ever had to deal with.I will say Louise was amazing to work with every time. Very responsive with a great attitude.It's unfortunate because I'm most likely going to find another primary care office in the near future because of my experience with Elizabeth and Burrell after they finally get the optumRX situation figured out.",1,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Brandon Hansen,"I went to the clinic on short notice while visiting my boyfriend who lives in SF. Great experience at a doctors office that puts the patient first! The staff was super nice, the office was spotless and Dr Greg was solely focused on making sure I was comfortable, taking the time to make sure he answered all of my questions in depth. Being able to set up the appointment, pay, and get my results and prescriptions through their mobile app made it the easiest experience to get convenient care on the go. Best doctor visit I've had in my life! Would 100% recommend to all friends.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"

Shantelle Henderson,"I have been twice to this location and I have to say the process of setting up you first visit and the paperwork is easy on the app, and so are the different convenient ways of setting up appointments. The location is nice and airy and my experience with Elizabeth, Julie (I think?) and others there have been amazing. I went for what ended up being strep throat and they took the time to listen to what I was feeling, did a rapid text to confirm it and sent me home with lots of instructions in the app and a prescription that you can send by email to your pharmacy. They also text back through the app if you have questions so overall, I totally recommend this location. I don't like doctors and going to them stresses me out but you feel cared for here.",5,Carbon Health,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice"
Avleen Field,"Felt like a doctor's office for the 21st century. Very impressed with their app integration and ease of use in providing patient information, setting up appointments, and follow-up.

Kai Klein,Best doctor experience ever! I made an appointment same day on the app and can enter all my info on the app. They communicate well through the app and there is never a wait when I go.

Monique Blankenship,"I don't write reviews often, but Carbon exceeded my expectations. Signing up was a breeze, just took photo of my insurance card and voila!

Habib Mcneil,"This is the best primary care practice in San Francisco. I've never heard of medical practice where I can directly text my physician, who is responsive to my needs, without paying a monthly fee.

Brandon-Lee Wagstaff,"Carbon Health is by far the family practice doctor experience I've ever had. Â Linda Dubins is a great doctor! She's very professional, thoughtful and genuinely cares about her patients.

Eve Macdonald,"Forward is ridiculous with their legal forms/contracts. I have probably signed over four or five contracts with them in approximately two yrs. It couldn't have been more than 30 days ago I signed the last one. I sat in a Forward exam room for nearly half an hour reading their new terms and conditions. I asked if they had future documents to sign that they email me when they are released, not drop them on me at the last minute right when I arrive at the Forward Office for a quick weigh in, vitals or even a doctor's appointment. Today, I used the Forward messaging app to confirm I could walk in and check my weight and oxygen level--simple, less than 3 minutes. The Forward Rep thru the app mention I needed to sign a contract. I informed the rep I signed one last month. The rep did not clarify if it was a new contract or not. Â It was not made clear until I walked into the Forward office nearly four hours later that Forward yet again updated their contract. Without signing it, I could not check my weigh and oxygen level. I walked out. I asked Forward to email the new contract. I asked them to indicate exactly what provisions or sections have been updated to their contract.

Â The Forward model works so much better than my previous HMO model, Dr Lam works on prevention and the ""why"" than just prescribing meds for every problem I encounter.

Bronwyn Hawkins,"I spent over 8 years working in the medical field and I left it to do marketing because I felt like healthcare became a way to make money rather than a way to treat and care for people. There were too many Doctors and Nurses with a God complex and they didn't really care about the well-being of their patients. With that said, I have always had really high expectations from my Doctors. I have spent my life only going to the best; but one thing was always lacking, preventative and 1:1 care. Doctors, no matter how amazing they are at their jobs prescribe medications for a symptom rather than helping to prevent that symptom. And worse, Â they spend less than 15 minutes with you when you just spent 30 minutes driving there, 30 minutes in their waiting room, 30 minutes in the patient room and 30 minutes to drive home. Forward was a completely different experience. The doctors are all Ivy League graduates. When you walk in, you feel like you've walked into an apple store, and all of their machines and tech is of the newest technology. You don't wait in a waiting room, and your doctor actually spends time with you to learn about whats going on with your body as well as what your goals are. They work with you to come up with a treatment and game plan and look deep into your body and genetics to know whats going on. My blood was drawn for my baseline visit (first visit) within 5 minutes of walking in. I was immediately given a Gluten Free, Allergen Free, Vegan, Non GMO snack and juice after the blood draw (had to fast). The Doctor walked in within 2 minutes of the lab tech walking out and she spent over an hour with me. Their app monitors my HR, Blood Pressure, Weight, and countless other things. They check in with you when something seems off and someone is there in their chat (within the app) 24/7 for any questions I have. I also thought it was really cool that the Doctor talks to you rather than looking down at the computer and charting. They have someone that is listening in that transcribes for the doctor so that the Doctor has 100% of your attention while they are with you the full hour. It would take me too long to go into all the specific details, but this is well worth the monthly cost considering every visit (no Â matter how many I need), every in-house lab and prescription and every skype call or message I send with questions is 100% covered. My genealogy testing, health and fitness plans are also covered.This is how healthcare should be. I highly suggest giving it a shot.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Tai Carlson,"This is how healthcare should be. Where it's customized to me and my needs and I'm meeting with people who care deeply to help. It's way more futuristic than I've ever seen a doctors office. I don't think I've seen the Apple store like this much less a doctor office tech wise lol.The fact that every part of our conversation was noted and added to my Forward profile in my app with book recommendations and health links is AMAZING. I don't have to feel pressure to memorize everything my doctor said or DIDN'T SAY while staring at a clipboard that they never show me lol. Also I can text the office through my app whenever. Even if I get in an injury and it's not serious enough to come in I can send a pic/message and get a response same day with instructions and recommendations! Makes you feel like even after you leave you are still important to them.My doctor is young and beautiful inside/out and beyond knowledgeable. She broke down each and every part of my test results. Did I mention they took blood and literally 10 min later all the results were on a touchscreen in my room? I needed an EKG and I got it right there and caught up on my shots. All included!Then upon leaving my first set of medications came for free in a dope gift bag that didn't look like I was carrying medication walking out of the building. No embarrassing eye stares from strangers for me lol.I've put so many people onto Forward and if you refer you get a month free for every person you refer! I think healthcare is moving into a new direction and I'm super here for it.Lastly, any additional testing that they can't do there they will send you out to get it done and that is additional but just to KNOW where my health is, SO important.

I was able to discuss my primary areas of concern, get some over the counter medication, and resources/apps to help track some of my other healthcare needs. I received information about vaccinations I should look into for different travel plans and I have been able to communicate via text about my progress with the medication and typically receive a response back within an hour.

I also have insurance with Kaiser and I am comforted knowing I have convential hospital care if I need it but the very best preventative care, using the most advanced technology in the industry. Living in 2020, a holistic approach to health is what will ensure we are strong and able to survive.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Yassin Gibson,What a really cool experience. I feel like I had all the time I needed with the doctor. She did not mind going back over things &amp; I can always look at the app to remember what to do. The process is so easy &amp; complete. Just press a button on the app to send your prescriptions to the pharmacy of your choosing. Â Love it !!!!,5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Lorelai Jarvis,"I can't believe how incredible this place is.Technology, professionalism, cleanliness, Dr. Lam is honest and helpful and encouraging and intelligent.The affordability on this is crazy as well I received a tetanus shot 3 vials of my blood was drawn, from which results were done in under an hour.We then went over everything on where I'm at and what my goals are.There's a huge monitor on the wall that was recording everything and updating everything as we talked I believe and there was no charts or any writing down it was like watching Iron Man with the technology. Anyways highly recommended.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Luna Wills,Amazing most awesome experience!This place is great! Full blood panel done on the premises no waiting for results. Doctor Brianna is very caring and spent time explaining the details.,5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"

Saffa Ramos,"After hopping from doctor to doctor, I landed at Forward where Dr. Lam has been my main physician for almost a year. Not only has Dr. Lam done more for my health in the last year than any other doctor has in my entire life, I am more motivated to live a healthier lifestyle. The app is easy to use with your questions being answered quickly, prescriptions ordered immediately and all your information you need in a clean and organized format. I plan on staying with forward forever.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Anam Finney,"My experience at Forward was *fine*, but it was expensive and the appointments are booked about a month out so you're constantly needing to wait. I wanted to cancel and figured since it was a subscription service and we paid for the whole month they would tell me the date it was cancelled...NOPE. They cancelled my account immediately, mid month, and wouldn't refund the rest of the month or allow me to use my account through the month we paid for. Ridiculous.",2,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Charlene Myers,"So far the service has been pretty straightforward and legit! Everything the promo video said has basically come through. The staff is very kind and professional. The payment plan is very affordable considering that I don't have insurance, the plan covers doctors visits and that's also including basic medications like inhalers and antibiotics. They ran my blood test and also a urine test. Covered! I'm grateful that a company like this exist. I pray that it sticks around for a long time. Thank you for whomever came up with this idea! This business model helps people that are in dire need of safe and reliable healthcare.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Nikki Brewer,"What a great experience. Not your normal Dr Office. They take the time t go through every detail of your health. Discuss it and create a plan.

Technology and medicine together.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Wanda Washington,"I've been going to Dr. Lam since mid-January of 2019. Â He is without question the best and most caring doctor I've had in my life. Â The quality of care is amazing - not just from the doctors but from the tech's. Â And I love the app, and the regular communication through it to check up on me.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Jasmin Donovan,"I kept seeing the ADs for this company everywhere, from my facebook feed, to my instagram updates and even started seeing them on youtube. So I decided to check out their site and see what this FORWARD is all about.To my surprise, there was a special for $99 for the first 3 months and I could book my first appointment the following Tuesday, (Monday was a holiday). So I figured I give this a try.It exceeded my expectations:PARKING: there is a lot just across the street that is free to park for 90 minutes. PERFECT amount of time since there really is NO WAIT time when you arrive. LOCATION: it is within The Americana but is located on Brand in between Frida and the coffee bean.EXPERIENCE: As soon as you walk in there is someone there to greet you. Since it was my first time there are a few disclosures and agreements that I needed to review and sign - digitally, of course, no more paper! You tap on your initials and your profile pops up on the big screen, you get your oxygen levels, weight and several other vitals measured and then you go into your room. There you see a very clean and slick room with a large touch screen on the wall. The nurse comes in breaks down what is going to happen takes blood samples and in walks the doctor, you talk about your history/concerns and just like that your blood results are on the screen! I swear it was like 5-10 minutes for the results to show up. The Doctor was very knowledgable and very caring, truly made me feel comfortable and made me truly believe she cared. I am glad I made the switch from my old primary (I would have to book at least a month in advance to see him). Now I can just walk in and boom I can update my profile, also you get everything you discussed on your app! and you can chat with your doctor if any concerns arise. RESULTS: I'm keeping my membership!",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Chance Nieves,I had my baseline appointment on Monday. Â I was questioning whether this was a good fit for me and I was so impressed with the way Forward is run. Hopefully one day all doctors offices will be doing business this way. I love the way it seems to be all based on preventative. Â That's the way I live. Â Keep your body in good shape by exercising. Eating right and something good for the brain too. I think I've found the right place with Forward! The staff are all so friendly. For the first time in my life I didn't mind having blood drawn. Â I think We all just get used to being treated like a number by the medical field. Â Now I feel like a person who matters Such a great feeling.,5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Elle Erickson,"First of all, the reception staff was EXCELLENT! The ladies were very welcoming and explained the process thoroughly.The intake process by the nurse was very pleasant in putting me to ease especially right before the blood test. Â Water and delicious energy bars were offered while waiting for the doctor, which was not too long of a wait.Dr. Richard Lim was my assigned doctor, and I was extremely pleased to have him. Â My visit with him was exceptionally outstanding. Â This is the first time in my life to have a very candid, open and extensive conversation with a medical doctor. Â Usually doctors can't wait to finish with you and get you out so the next patient comes in. Â My time with Dr. Lim was definitely time well-spent. Â He is very thorough in his explanation and I can see how caring and sincere he was with the time he spent with me. Â Can't wait for my next visit.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Valerie Redman,"I had my first appointment last week. I have SO many great things to say. This is everything a doctor's visit and preventative healthcare should be!- First, I love that they're located in malls. Parking is a breeze and usually free (or way cheaper than parking at a doctor's office)- NO WAITING. I walked in 5 minutes early, and everything was ready to go. They offered me water, and it wasn't crappy water either - still or sparkling options!- The nurse was so sweet, very attentive, gave me a Spiderman band-aid after taking blood. There was also a choice of Frozen band-aids! Since I was fasting due to blood tests, I was even offered snacks. Talk about going above and beyond with their customer service- The doctor was incredibly talented in many different ways. Not only did he really care about my health priorities and understand them medically, but he was tech-savvy, and I really appreciated that. It made the decision-making process about what I should change or optimize a breeze. This approach was also less anxiety-inducing because he had information and support at his fingertips- Testing turn-around time is nothing like I've ever seen. Even when they had to do further testing, I was notified in the app in just under 24 hours- The membership includes so much. The doc and I decided to change a prescription. Since they had the new medication on-site, I walked away WITH that medication. No charge for it and future refills. Usually, I'd have to take more time out of my day to visit the pharmacy- Follow-up messaging and test results were posted in the app within hours. I love having this data easily and readily accessible. They also included supplemental reading and clear plans to follow for health optimizationAs an entrepreneur, the time I saved using Forward helps me immensely. Getting coverage as a self-employed person is expensive and finding the time to do it comprehensively is challenging. I may even downgrade my health insurance and save a few bucks because the Forward membership has so many great benefits.If I could change anything, it would be the genetic testing. I wish there was another way to do it without having to go through 23andMe. I just have my concerns about that company.Otherwise, no complaints. Looking forward to my next visit and feeling positive about my health.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Leticia Beach,"I'm very healthy but in between insurance provided by my employer. Â I wanted to make sure I had access to basic bloodworm, weight loss suggestions, and overall health. Â My baseline information and testing was excellent and quick. Everyone was intelligent and informative. Â It's not a clinic or doctor's office. Â I've received healthcare in other countries but this was a new experience. Â It's more streamline and efficient, while friendly and professional.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Aizah Waller,"completely different experience i have ever imagined. top notch, SUPER clean, and dr. brittaney took as much time as we needed to review everything. she was thorough, kind and patient. also got my blood results within 10 minutes. everything was shown to me on a large touch screen in different categories, whilst a scribe was listening and taking notes! it was truly incredible...and i can't stress enough the cleanliness and efficiency of this establishment. i am honestly in awe. you can connect to the app as well for 24/7 interaction and any questions and concerns you may have. this is how healthcare should be. i am super pleased with my visit.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"

Susannah Boyd,"I just started with Forward, and I'm blown away. I've never Â experienced such thorough, responsive, and proactive health care. Dr. Lam took the time to go through my entire medical history, my lab results, and my goals. He then helped me come up with a comprehensive, preventative healthcare plan. All the notes, results, and action items were helpfully summarize in my app, and the Forward team is FAST in dealing with referrals, record requests, and other items doctors offices typically take ages to take care of. I was skeptical, but this really does fee like how healthcare should be.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"

Listened to all my concerns even my skin tags. Love that u could text or call 24/7 for medical support. Great staff and professionals. Very high tech and love the focus of the clinic which is health and not money. Very excited for my dna test and future exams. Even my wife is sold on this clinic.

Boyd Mcfadden,"When it comes to medical care, I set the bar really high so when I arrived at Forward Glendale for my baseline I questioned how this high tech approach would measure up. My 1st impression was surprise- no waiting! Â There was a cool easy check in process before I got onto the body scanner. Â I was amazed at the information collected from the scan and painless blood draw! Â Dr. Richard went Â through these results and my health concerns until ALL of my questions were answered. Â dr Richard! Â The follow up from Forward through the app for specialty referrals and when I had a horrible stomach fluwas immediate and on point. Â Love Forward- there's nothing like it! Make sure you ask for Alexis and Maxine who get you set up, they're so positive, Â and give an absolutely painless flu shot!!!",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Mariana Jaramillo,"Wow. This is a place where you actually feel like the future is now. Sure, there's a lot of technology to impress, but really what makes it an excellent service is the data set that you review with the doctor and can use in the app. Having a reminder of actionable items specific to the tests is a key to successfully co-opting a more healthy lifestyle. Dr. Belyeu is warm and caring and thoughtful. The initial appointment didn't feel rushed and having blood test results in like 15 minutes is mind blowing. Â Response of questions in the app is immediate. With health, from a mental perspective - waiting for answers is usually the worst part. Truly an example where the current way of doing things is outmoded and it's time for change. Bravo.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"

Clay Bowman,"From what I can tell so far Forward is a total scam! Baseline appointments are available only during week days and for very limited periods of the day, 8-2 for some reason. Only x2 doctors at this location and I see them aggressively advertising on Social Media so I can only assume they are over selling their services given the long wait times for appointments. After waiting for almost two months to have my baseline appointment I get a notice that it's canceled because apparently they let 50% of their staff just randomly not come to work!

Caring, has patience and understanding! I've never felt rushed, the first visit was well over an hour when your ""traditional"" doctor visit rushes you in and out as fast as possible to keep charging everyones insurance i guess. You get what you pay for right? They offer different types of water, got a health monitoring watch for free just so my health could be tracked 24/7 ohhh and let me not forget the fact that I could literally be in contact with someone 24/7 should i need someone at 4am!

Leo Winter,"I have to start out by noting two things a) I am a visual learner and b) I love my doctor who has done right by me for 25 years. This was a 10-star experience. It is a sleek, clean, comfortable environment that feels futuristic but familiar. A welcoming young woman met me at the door, introduced herself, talked to me about what to expect and helped me check in - which consisted of tapping my initials on a pad. No lines, no wait - next was the body scan with my information populating a forward facing screen. A nurse appeared and took me to a room straight away. I had typed up a list of my surgeries with dates, including meds, family history and current topics to discuss. The nurse ran a handheld machine up my arm to expose my veins with ultraviolet light, then took blood and gave me an amazing healthy bar and some water (""We know you are hungry after fasting""). She gave me a comfy t-shirt and I saw that there were exercise shorts that apparently took the place of a clingy plastic gown. I know that these things are inconsequential - but they typified the entire experience and that's why I choose to add them. Immediately, Dr. Richard Lam entered the room, relaxed and patient, asking questions and overlooking the intake that I prepared. I can't really explain it but I guess the oversized monitor on the wall was picking up key medical terms as he was chatting with me. When I said that I was having a problem he responded and the ailment popped up on the screen with sub context. My labs were on screen as well. We went over every part of my body and documented all issues regardless of how incidental they were. Reassuringly, he called my attention to the screen to show me my levels from the full panel within a graphic that enabled me to assess where I was on the spectrum for diabetes etc. It was very different than, ""Yeah, you blood sugar is a little high,"" - on the bar I saw how high and what my ranges were. Preliminary diagnoses' populated and he would dictate to the computer what the goals were without breaking eye contact with me - layer after layer of information was visible. At this point I felt like I was ""cheating"" on my doctor because I was connected to this doctor, this experience, the feeling of being understood and having a grasp and taking control of my health. I was assured that FORWARD was a program that worked in tandem with my GP. It's collaborative. We made goals and plans and he asked me for my phone to get a baseline of how many steps that I took. No cheating there! I pushed back on some action items that I wasn't up to at the moment and he was encouraging and nonjudgmental and worked with me to formulate a workable plan that I was confident that I could successfully execute. Toward the end of the visit he asked two questions - having nothing to do with anything that we had talked about. Â He asked if family and friends had noticed very specific visual change in my appearance - and I shared that they had. There is NO WAY that he would know to ask those questions. We ended up with a plan that includes a regiment of daily fasting, titrating off medication that isn't intended to be a long-term treatment plan and he listened (without judgment or any sign of disbelief) when I said that I use chocolate for medicinal Â purposes as a sleep aid. He worked chocolate into my plan - I mean seriously - that's really subscribing to the fact that we know our bodies. Â Within days, he chatted with me via the app, uploaded my full blood panel results with explanations and helped me navigate what the results meant. We confirmed our goals which contained our action plan taking into consideration the descriptions of every diagnosis and my profile. Because he will study my progress it motivates me to find excuses to walk more, give my body a rest by fasting, cut down on my pills and eradicate certain foods from my diet in moderation. The bottom line is that it was an incredible experience. Not one that is easily described. This doctor is exceptional. The facility is extraordinary, the staff, knowledgeable and gentle. I give this facility my highest recommendation and I plan reap the benefits of having a team of experienced doctors (+ my GP) help me with my preventative approach to healthy living.",5,Forward,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine"
Ezmae Velez,"Since our regular doctor was out of town, her assistant referred us to Doctors Kim and Savant when my wife was ill. Â Dealing with Dr. Savant was a pleasant surprise from the beginning.

Â What a fine gentleman he is, and he has a great bedside manner, and sense of humor.

Ashton Cousins,"So I have to say - LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Savant. Â He was my doctor since 2005 when I moved here from Chicago. Â  Sadly we now do need to part ways because of this whole annual fee deal. I just can't afford him after I pay for my insurance. Â And sadly, while I did think to go to Dr. Kim, I've noticed a decline in the great customer service I used to receive before this whole annual fee. Â Now when trying to get perscriptions, leaving messages, or at times when I actually talked to the receptionist - it's like pulling teet to get a response. Â Because of the lack of response from the front desk I've decided to just find another doctor.It comes down to this - if you can afford to pay the additional fee, Dr. Savant is a great doctor and I can't say enough. Â If like me, you can't - just move on to another doctor's office.

Neelam Kline,"It's 8 years later and I haven't seen Dr. Savant because I changed my primary care doctor, not because I was dissatisfied but because my health coverage changed. My husband recently needed a new primary care doctor and the first person I thought of was Dr. Savant. My husband has had a couple of visits with Dr. Savant and had nothing but great things to say. Although his health report isn't the greatest, Dr. Savant thoroughly went over every lab result explaining the possible causes and what are some steps he can take to improve those numbers in his diet. He just simply took his time to make sure that my husband understood everything so that he has control over his health. It's also rare these days that you can just call in and get an appointment within 24 hours let alone the same day. It's been an overall comforting experience to know my husband is in good hands.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Natan Rosales,"I feel the need to chime in here. Â Dr. Savant is hands down the best doctor I have ever seen in my life. Â Now, for me that says a lot because I recently went through a major life changing illness. I won't elaborate on the details of my condition but suffice it to say that I ended up receiving a stem cell transplant which required intensive after care. Â With luck, I found Dr. Savant and after 3 years of illness and treatment, he became my primary care physician.What a relief. Â To find a doctor that is not only brilliant medically, but also compassionate and one who never, I mean never, rushes the visit. Â We all know that some visits to your doctor are quickies and others require a bit more time, depending upon what is going on.Prior to becoming so ill, I had always been healthy, never sick. Â Suddenly, Â my life changed dramatically as I had lost the membership of Â someone considered ""healthy."" Â  Â Dr. Savant was attentive, in touch and astute to the entire experience. Â I could not have asked for a better physician for my aftercare. Â Eventually, I regained my health but continue to deal with the after effects of those years of illness as well as the aggressive treatment I had. Â Again, Dr. Savant skillfully and kindly led me through the painful long months of healing and escorted me back to heath and subsequently work, as a full duty police officer.Then, at the beginning of 2012, we received a Savant Wellness Package in the mail-- it require us to pay a lump some, yearly, to belong to his practice and continue to see Dr. Savant. Â It ranged but I think my cost, and my partner's, was in the ballpark of $2000.00 annually for each of us. Â At first we were shocked, even a bit indignant. Â My initial reaction was: Â Okay, he's great but that is way too much money. Â Let's look around for another doctor, one that doesn't ask for a Â fee to see him. Â We found ourselves back in the rat-race of hurried doctors that didn't even bother to ascertain our medical history from the simplest things like whether we smoked to my major recent illness. Â Sigh... Â We missed good medicine, we missed Dr. Savant.My partner and I talked about the annual fee and searched online about physicians charging fees. Â We realized that the best doctors are moving towards this practice and evaluated for ourselves what we wanted, for our own healthcare. Â After careful consideration, we decided that excellent medicine--Dr. Savant-- was worth it. Â After all, I had long since experienced the contrary and after having been extremely ill, our decision became a no brainer. Â We paid. Â And you know what? Â I'm glad we did. Â In short, there is no price on health, good health. Â Unfortunately, we often don't realize it until it is something we have lost...Dr. Savant is an amazing physician. Â If you can afford to pay his fees, I highly encourage you to do so. Â Nothing is more important than your health even if that is hard to fathom when you have it.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Harper Rush,"Trying to find a doctor. Called last week. Asked the receptionist the usual simple questions about bloodwork and physical assessments that are performed there. Got no useful answer.

Kasey Park,"Unfortunately, this office has questionable ethics standards. I strongly recommend reviewing the bill and discussing the charges with the doctor - the front desk won't cooperate much post factum.I was looking for an OBGYN, and, by mistake, I ended up in this office. I waited for 35 minutes in the waiting room just to find out that I came to the wrong doctor. The doctor did manage to ask me if I smoked, drank, and did drugs. He also asked if my parents had any health issues. And that's when we got to the mistaken OBGYN part. We shook hands and wished each other a good day. Imagine my surprise when I got a bill for a complete (!!) physical exam. When I called to clarify the situation, the front desk said that it was their policy to charge people (I think as soon as they schedule or enter the office). She would not correct the charge!I suggest they should have a credit card machine at the door by the door knob because, apparently, sitting in their waiting room is not free!Also, I am a CPA, and my billing rate is $280. I sat in their office for 35 minutes. I think they owe me $163! They got as much of my accounting services as much I got of the physical exam, but I had to pay.

I start coughing all over his face. Not cute. Something had to be done.In the four years that I have lived in the Bay Area, I never really had any reason to go to the doctor so I didn't really have one.Turned to Yelp and originally wanted to make an appointment with Dr Savant. Nothing available for a few weeks. Oh noes! I had to stop coughing. So I was thinking that, you know, good doctors, work with good doctors. So I asked if there was anyone else that could take me. They offered Dr Kim for a same day appointment. I was in.Went in, saw Dr Kim and was amazed. I was so used to doctors, sticking a swab down my throat, asking me like 2 questions, and be out of there in 5 minutes with a prescription. Dr Kim actually talked to me for a good 30 minutes about my symptoms what kind of activities I do, all kinds of stuff to help fix this incredibly annoying issue I was having.So yeah, a week later, cough all gone. Dream.THANK YOU DR KIM.Talking to people at the bars is so much easier now thanks to you.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Thiago Clay,"The Short: Compassionate, timely, efficient.The Long:I made my appointment about 4 weeks ago, showed up on time, waited about 3 minutes to be seen, and had Dr. Savant's uninterrupted attention for about an hour. Â He brought his laptop into our session, and was taking copious notes about everything. Â I had brought a few pieces of paper from my last appointment, and he efficiently scanned them in to my file. Â There was almost no paperwork, except for the notes and prescriptions he printed out.Personally, Dr. Savant is awesome. Â He was a classics major, and then became a doctor. Â He is funny, compassionate, and probably the best doctor I've ever seen. Â I hope his practice thrives enough that he knows he is loved, but not so much that making an appointment is impossible.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Stefan Plummer,"I have been a patient of Dr. Savant since about 2001. Â He's hands down the best doctor I've ever seen. Â It's not even close. Â There's Dr. Savant, then there's everyone else.Mark spends a lot of time actually talking to you. Â He's interested in what's going on in your life, and how it impacts your health. Â He's designed his entire practice to be able to spend that time with his patients. Â He's also extremely knowledgable and will ensure you get the treatment you need.For a brief period sometime during 2011-2012, his practice ended up taking on more patients than it could handle (thanks to the awesome Yelp reviews). Â As a result, he expanded his practice to include Dr. Kim, who is also a great doctor. Â So yes, during that transition, I noticed longer wait times and it being harder to get in to see Dr. Savant. Â During this time Mark added a concierge service so people who wanted him 24/7 could have it. Â Obviously nothing comes for free, so there is an annual charge. Â I would love to do it, but I decided I couldn't afford it. RECENT Experiences: I have been 4 times in the last six months, and I will tell you that each time I have arrived early. Â Each and every time I have been taken to an exam room within 10 minutes of arrival. Â Each and every time Mark has come in to see me in that room within 5 to 10 minutes (twice immediately!).If you're looking for the best doctor on the planet, you've found him. Â His name is Dr. Mark Savant.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Kristian Ferrell,"I hadn't been to the doctor in a LONG time. Â The ""current"" complaints I came up with during my new patient/pysical were all at least 6 months old. Â I was terrified to go in there but knew it had to be done. Â Dr. Savant is the coolest! Â Young, up-to-date, down-to-earth, and totally caring. Â No lengthy questionaire to go over your life story--he asks the questions himself. Â Talks about options and concerns, not pushy about his own opinions or agendas.Doris is really sweet. Â Zora is a new assistant and really a bright, young face in the office. Â Dr. Savant told me that he likes to run the kind of practice you can call and say, ""Hey, I need to be seen today,"" and they'll fit you in. Â I like a doctor like that. Â But after all the response from Yelp, he's had to bring in Dr. Kim to help him keep running his practice that way. Â Hey, that's not a bad thing!I've never walked away from a doctor's appointment and raved about it. Â I've ranted plenty of times but raved? Â I can't think of one. Â I love this guy.Oh, and I totally agree with what Clover Dan said--""a doctor you won't hate talking to, no matter what the hell you did to end up there."" Â Well put and spot on!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Kitty William,"Wow, holy cow, a medical office with an actual person I can talk to? Â You mean, I don't have to listen to a voice recording and push numbers and cross my fingers that it brings me to the right place? I appreciate that there's a human on the other line, and I appreciate that they were able to give me an appointment in the next two days. Â I mean, when you're sick and you think you've got a sinus infection, the last thing you want to do is keep the phone by your ear and hope you don't miss the doctor's office when they call back. Â So pleasant that I could speak to someone, and make my appointment.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Autumn Ruiz,"I waited almost 4 weeks for my appointment with Dr. Savant for a non-urgent but bothersome issue, so I was ready to rip Yelp another one if he was just another competent but over-hyped person.Sitting in his dimly lit waiting room for 40 minutes next to a pharmaceutical drug rep and listening to elevator music, I was really considering that idea. Â But tout au contraire, Dr. Savant lived up to the raves. Â His Q Q Q Q A A A Â format, versus Q A Q A Q A (question-answer etc.), initially threw me off and made me wonder whether he was listening or caring, but he had truly excellent bedside manner and asked that rare ""Is there anything else?"" question at the end. Â No wonder he runs late. Â The only thing that disappointed was when he told me over the phone that my allergy test results indicated I had allergies to ""some kind of weed"" and ""I think it's wheat grass"". Â I requested a copy and googled the scientific names, and it turned out the ""weed"" (D. pteronyssinus) is the European house dust mite and ""wheat grass"" (D. farinae) is the American house dust mite.Oh well. Â Dr. Savant's no zoologist, that's for sure.",4,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Andreas O'Brien,"Dr. Savant was recommended to me by a close friend. Â It was a good choice. Â From first impression, you can tell he really wants to get to know patients (their lifestyle, concerns etc.). Â He gave some useful and beneficial tips on health and fitness.The office procedures seem very organized, which is a plus. Â You don't see files and papers all around. Â They're all about using laptops and computers at this place. Â It's reassuring.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Arnold Byers,"Since I have moved from New Orleans to San Fran, I have never been to a BETTER dr than Dr Kim! i ABSOLUTELY adore this guy! First off, hats off to his AMAZING staff, Jessica and Sophia. You two make it happen! These ladies got it going on! They are on top of everything and are a pleasure to talk to on the phone. When it comes to Dr. Kim (Ive never seen Dr Savant but Im sure he is amazing too) I am always welcomed with open arms and a warm greeting. He does not rush me---he listens and let's me get all my feelings out. He sits there with his little computer and takes notes and also really genuinely pays attention to YOUR needs. He is SO accommodating. I'll never use another dr. If I could give them 10 stars I would.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Makenzie Hodgson,"I couldn't agree more with the 5 stars rating for Dr. Savant....being a typical male I avoid the doctor at all cost--because you know nothing is ever wrong with us guys. Â Nevertheless, I made an appointment and must say it was a great experience. Â Office was efficient and staff was friendly. Â  Dr. Savant has excellent bed side manner...highly recommend.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Ria Dorsey,"When I changed jobs and switched from Kaiser to Blue Cross a few years ago, I had to select a new primary care physician. I'd rarely needed to see a doctor for anything (knock wood), so I didn't take the task of choosing one very seriously. If memory serves, I just randomly picked Dr. Savant from a list on the Blue Cross website.I lucked out.I've had to visit him a handful of times over the past few years, and I've had nothing but the most positive experiences. He has an amazing ability to educate without talking down or dumbing down. Like most doctors, he's probably very busy, but you'd never know it. He gives you his full attention, spends as much time with you as you need and never gives the impression he's in a hurry.I highly recommend Dr. Savant.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Yasir Franco,"Well, after not having been to a doctor in many years, I was relieved to find Dr. Savant to be so welcoming and thorough. I went in with a bit of a medical dilemma, and he spent a lot of time talking about my medical background and other ongoing problems I have that need to be addressed and perhaps could have been linked to my current issue.  I really enjoyed the experience and I'm happy to have found a primary care doctor that I can feel good about seeing regularly.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Gina Gunn,"It's that time of year... time to get checked out. Â Luckily, I've finally been having a streak of fantastic luck finding good health care providers! Â Dr. Savant is one of them.Really knowledgeable and down to earth and super techy - at least more so than any doctor I've had before! Â No more scribbly notes and yellow copy this and pink copy that... everything I need is printed out nice and neat for me.The wait wasn't bad and the office staff were actually really friendly - I know, can you imagine? Â There was no rushed feeling and no playing the game of ""which door is the doctor behind now"". Â I didn't have brain freeze when I had the chance to ask any questions because I felt like I knew that I could always ask later! Â At last a doctor that I can actually have a conversation with and maybe even shoot the breeze a bit with. Â Hooray!!!The final thing that convinced me to end my search for a SF doc was the decorative plate of The Simpsons on his office bookshelf. Â Done deal.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Annabelle Farrell,"Dr. Savant and Dr. Kim are absolutely 5-star all stars. Â The receptionists (I have spoken to Sophia) are also very accommodating and understanding. Â I have called in twice for last minute emergencies and they were able to accommodate me the same-day, even though both doctors had booked schedules.These doctors care about you, your life, your needs, your interests and your health. Â It's a refreshing way to be treated!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Jovan Paul,"I saw Mark last week, and the reviews didn't disappoint. Â He's a cool guy. Â I hadn't seen a doctor in a while, so I gave him a rundown of some of my concerns. Â He addressed all of them, explained things to me thoroughly, and gave me a few samples on top of my perscriptions.We exchanged a few bits about growing up in San Francisco. Â The conversation was really relaxed. Â I got the feeling that Mark cares more about a person as a whole than just their ailments. Â I really appreciated that.On the flip side, the Yelp recommendation comes at a price. Â In order to get an appointment with him, I had to book almost a month in advance. Â I picked the last available appointment on the day I went, and had to wait an extra 40 minutes to see him.Despite this, he took his time and wasn't in a rush. Â After we left the examination room, the entire office was empty--he was the last guy to leave the office. Â That really says something to me about his commitment.As long as I don't have any immediate medical concerns, I'd like to keep Mark as my doctor.",4,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Roger Molina,"It took me a 3 year search to find Dr. Savant, and now I know I've found my doc!Mark is incredibly smart, kind, knowledgeable, and attentive. Â He is like a private investigator on my team that really wants to get to the bottom of my health issues. Â Most importantly, he is SUPER SERVICE oriented. Â He and I even spoke on the phone 3 times to follow up on my issues after just one visit, and he never charged me again. Â Incredible.My only quibble is that St. Mary's Medical Center charges another whopping fee on top of the separate bill he issues. Â But in the end, it's worth my commute from Berkeley and worth every penny I've paid.I definitely give Mark a 5 star rating. Â If you want a top notch internal medicine doc, he's your man.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Colin Acosta,"This office has been terrific for me. Â I am a patient of Dr. Kim. Â I have seen him separately for complications with a broken toe, and for acute back pain. Â Dr. Kim does not suffer from some of the issues I've had with other doctors in the past, where assumptions were made about my ability to understand options and the potential factors to a problem. Â Being a reasonably web-savvy person, I tend to do my homework about what might be going wrong, and what to do about it. Â Dr. Kim talks to me at the level that I'm at, and we come to an agreement on diagnostic approaches and the right specialist consultation or treatment we want to go with. Â It's nice to have a collaborative doctor.The last time I saw him, I couldn't walk, so his friendly office staff set me up with a wheelchair and delivered me to the hospital across the parking lot.When I go to see Dr. Kim, I know I'm in good hands.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Saffron Betts,"Mark has been my doctor for over six years. Â I came to Dr. Savant when he worked at UCSF Medical Center. Â He has remained my doctor through many jobs and, more recently, through a move to the East Bay. Â I still come to Dr. Savant because he has always provided genuine empathy in dealing with my health issues. Â He is a fantastic doctor and exhibits a wonderful bed-side manner that helps to alleviate patient concerns. Â In addition to being a wonderful physician, Dr. Savant's maintains a well-organized (and now, highly computerized) office with the help of Doris, his assistant. Â Mark continues to stay abreast of the newest technologies and treatments. Â As such, he always ensures that his patients receive the best care possible. Â I am extremely glad that I have been able to keep Dr. Savant as my physician for all these years. Â Both he and Doris are truly wonderful. Â They make a great team!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Joy Mcintosh,"Dr. Gene Kim is an excellent primary care physician. Â He has great bedside manner and will take all the time necessary to explain things, so you understand your health. Â His office is very responsible and they can generally get you in on short notice. Â I've also visited his partner, Dr. Savant, and can only say excellent things about him as well.

Cecelia Young,"I just went for my first appointment with Dr Savant, and he was great. Â He stayed with us for a long time and asked very insightful questions. Â And he was funny. ^_^I'm really excited to find a doctor that I really like!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Mathew Alvarez,"Found this doctor off of Yelp and love him so far - I can tell that he cares about his patients and is a dedicated practitioner...Pros: Really sits down and listens to you share all of your symptoms, thinks holistically, will stay late to call back patients, high tech - maintains patient files on the computer and will give you a computerized printout of your prescription - or call it in the pharmacy for you!Cons: His office staff workers are a little bit busy - but only because he is so popular - I have no problem with that because you can tell that they are doing the best they can and care about the patients as well - they provide high quality service.His office is really close to the University of San Francisco campus - enter in from the entrance at Stanyan &amp; Fulton St (same intersection as Fulton &amp; Parker) - all you have to do is go down one floor and you're there. Â  Also note - because this office is part of the hospital, they don't have their own labs in office - if you have to do a urine test or any blood work you'll have to visit the Lab on the 4th floor - they might not stay open late even if his office does!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Lynden Cope,"I've been lagging on finding a pcp for a while now...but a close friend of mine recommend me to him and I'm glad that I made an appointment. The best quality that Dr. Savant has is that he listens and actually talks the patient. He sits there with a laptop and types any pertinent info needed to figure out a diagnosis for you. He def. knows his stuff and is very professional at all times. Very easy going, very easy to talk to, and had an overall fantastic experience in the office.Make sure you call and book an appointment as soon as you need - because he books up quick! As a new patient, it took me 6 weeks to get an appointment, but Dr. Savant assured me that once you are an established patient, it becomes easier to book a last min appt (for those icky colds!) so now that I'm a patient of his, I'm golden!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Yousef Green,"I simply LOVE Dr. Savant. I have some complex medical issues that necessitate frequent dr. Visits and intervention. Despite having a very busy practice, Dr. Savant always takes the time to compassionately listen to my concerns. That is such a rarity these days. I am always afraid I will be blown off by doctors because I am so young and have so many medical issues; I have never gotten that vibe from Dr. Savant. He comes across as someone who genuinely cares.His office staff is wonderful as well. Ashamedly, I can't remember their names. They are totally on top of things and return phone calls promptly.The only downside is that sometimes the wait times are a little longer than some other offices because he is so busy.Give Dr. Savant a try; you won't be disappointed. PS- I found him through yelp.com!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Saoirse Chang,"Dr. Savant, is kind, intelligent, open and listens. Â I have seen him for check ups, minor illnesses, etc over the years and he always makes me feel better -- and if he can't he refers me to a specialist (e.g. when I needed to find a good Ob-Gyn etc). Â No pretentions, takes excellent notes. Â He is truly the best.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Natalya Hinton,"I've been seeing Dr. Savant for at least 10 years (holy shit I can't believe its been that long!) and I can't speak highly enough about him. He is compassionate and genuinely cares about his patients. Plus he takes the time to sit and talk with you-who does that anymore? He has come to the rescue on two occasions when I was misdiagnosed by other doctors, and helped me get rid of nasty colds so that I would be well enough to enjoy my travels. The staff (especially Doris) is also great and have always (literally every time in the last 10 years) been able to squeeze me in at the last minute when I was feeling horrible. Yay Doctor Savant!p.s. Just so you know, he's taking notes on his laptop not looking up your diagnosis on WebMd... I may or may not have been wondering about this when he first started using the laptop during exams a few years back :)",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Reuben Lucero,"I've seen Dr. Savant many times. I am definitely not into Western Medicine in general and a Western doctor is not my first choice for Health Care, but Savant is not your average Western doctor. He doesnt push drugs and his office is pleasantly devoid of many advertisements and such by drug companies. He is a good listener and is interested in developing relationships with his patients. He has called me a few times over concerns, which ended up preventing a doctor's visit and saving me money as well.  Especially in a world where finding a western Doctor who even seems human is always difficult, Dr. Savant is definitely a breath of fresh air.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Josie Derrick,"A doctor at his best! Â It is thanks to Yelp that I found my primary doctor. Dr. Savant is open-minded, caring, and listens to your needs. He is absolutely knowledgeable and tells it like it is. He is not one of those old-fashioned doctors either; he puts everything in his laptop and stays up to date with technology for better business.Although it is hard to book a last minute appointment, that's just because he's so popular and all his clients trust him. Â He will forever be my doctor!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Â I was told when I called ""didn't you receive our letter?"". Â No, I did not. Â And it does not matter - I don't even want to know if your annual fee is really $1500 a year on top of co-pay as some reviewers state here on Yelp.

Harvey Kelley,"Thank you to Yelp and to all of the Yelpers for helping me find my new PCP. Â My last PCP was GREAT, but she left practice and I was left wondering how I would EVER find another physician who I would be able to trust , as much. Â Well, I found him.My prerequisites for a Primary Care Physician and his/her practice are very clear:1) The practice should accept my insurance.2) The reception staff should be friendly and efficient.3) The MD should be PROFESSIONAL and KNOWLEDGEABLE4) I should not be left waiting for HOURS....for a consultation5) The consultation should be thorough.6) There should be NO JUDGMENT tied to my revelation of any of my ""habits"", perhaps only recommendations on how I can improve my health by abstaining from those listed ""habits"".7) There should be open dialogue and a confirmation of confidentiality to create a safe environment to build a true Physician-Patient relationship.8) The invasive diagnostic procedures should be kept to a minimum, if possible, and the MD should be thoughtful about the repercussions of such diagnostics.9) Billing should be spot on.10) I should be able to call in an urgent situation (not a 911 situation) and be fit into the schedule, if possible.I've been to Dr. Savant's practice twice now and have been pleased. Â Once was to establish myself as a patient and to have a routine, preventative care examination. Â He was thorough and sensitive to my needs and my questions. Â He was easy to talk to and not intimidating (like some physicians can be). Luckily, I'm pretty healthy, so it was not a chore of a visit.The second visit was for an upper respiratory infection. For that visit, I did see Dr. Kim. Â Dr. Kim was extremely professional and very cognizant of my concerns. Â He seems very young, but he is professional and I felt that my health issues were addressed appropriately. Â Plus, I was VERY happy that the staff was able to fit me in QUICKLY (on the SAME DAY of my call)!!!!THANKS SO MUCH!!!!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Dewey Berg,"I have now seen Dr. Savant a few times for a general checkup and when I have some self-inflicted damage to myself. My last trip was somewhat urgent (non-emergency) and they were able to get me in the next day. He is very capable, straightforward, and takes the time to get to know you as a person, not just a meal-ticket. In my experience, I have been shown to an exam room at or damn near the time of my appointment and never waited more than a few minutes for him to come in. Your wait times may vary, but this place is seems far more efficient than other facilities I've been in (the horror stories I could tell!). Doris is incredible, super sweet, and very helpful. Yea, I sound a bit like a giddy schoolgirl, but as far as doctors and doctor offices go, you are unlikely to have a better experience elsewhere.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Liyana Oconnor,"So you move to a new city and start over, besides food and drink there are certain other necessities you need, a doctor and dentist being two.After much procrastinated physicals,my wife and I went to yelp and found him, made new patient appts and got in there pretty quickly.He's pretty chill (I bet he puffs a bit on the side) and sits with you with his apple notebook.Bedside manner makes you feel comfortable and he gave me all the referrals you could ask for (since our HMO, Aetna, requires referrals for specialists)There was a bit of a wait, I had a 2pm appt, showed up at 205, got seen at 245, my chagrin as I shoulda showed up 15mins early to fill out paperwork.(Was also bit sweaty, rode bicycle there, many hills on Fulton, not the best idea, take Fell or the bus or drive)There is cheap parking in the builidng itself, which is on top of a hillThere's something to be said about giant medical complexes in general, it's nice to have a 1 stop shopAfter his visit, I walked downstairs and had blood work 15mins laterBooked an apt w/ Dr Murray (in same office for the next day) and made 2 more apts for Fri for other stuff, so that's 5 medical appts knocked out in 3 days, Â not too shabby",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Raheem Moran,"I want to say that Dr. Savant has been a really great M.D. as well as a friend. Â The front staff are without equal, that being Doris and Sophia and the new addition. Â I am not sure why Dr. Savant has gone ""concierge"" on us and is not my business. Â He has left me in the care of Dr. Kim who is tremendous and quite quickly understood me and my situation to create a patient/doctor relationship that seems to be a perfect fit. Â He is truly awesome and has such a wonderful outlook and persona. Â I really am grateful for this apparently seamless transition while still being connected to the front desk folks whom I Â admire for their understanding and compassion.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Patrick Lambert,"Dr. Savant and his associate, Dr. Kim (I believe that's his name) have been the utmost professional medical care practitioners that I have had the pleasure of meeting. Â They are skilled, smart and provide me with important information and recommendations as to how to lead a more healthy lifestyle. Â They take a very pro-active approach towards medical treatment and don't break the bank for their patients (or for this one, anyway). Â I cannot recommend them highly enough!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Khaleesi Hernandez,"Got an appointment with Dr. Kim on a very short notice. Staff were nice and helpful. Dr. Kim was just as nice, professional, and he seemed like a genuinely good guy. This was my second ever doctor's appointment in the US, and I'm continually impressed by the level of professionalism here (maybe because I found both through Yelp).All in all, highly recommended :-)",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Madiha Morley,"Best primary care doctor I've ever had, hands down. The practice is organized-- if you call, you get a call back quickly. If you're acutely sick, they fit you in. Dr. Savant sends prescriptions from his laptop to his printer wirelessly and there you go. Both he and his assistant Doris are down-to-earth, friendly, and knowledgeable. If you're shopping for a doctor, stop shopping. This is your man.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Clement Weir,"If you need a new doc, stop looking cuz Dr. Savant is pretty awesome. Â Don't be deterred by the last name.. he's half Chinese! Â He is understanding, tells it like it is, and sympathetic to pain. Â There is no ""suck it up"" attitude, and he is great at explaining what medication and therapies will do for you. Â My previous doc was nice, cared, but I never knew why he was doing what he was doing. Â Dr. Savant is a very good change.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Ifan Squires,Dr. Savant is a stand up guy. I came to him with a sensitive problem and not only did he listen carefully he really worked with me to come up with a short term and long term solution. He was extremely sensitive and made me feel very comfortable talking to him. My only regret is that I didn't find him sooner!,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Polly Gamble,"My fiance needed to see the doctor for a regular check up. We recently moved to the city so we used Yelp to find a good doctor. We tried to get an appointment for Dr. Savant but he is too popular and the wait was too long for new patients. Instead, we saw Dr Kim. He is AWESOME. Hands down the best doctor I've ever experienced. He came into the room with his laptop, asked questions, listened, and explained things. We had a list of things we were asking about. Dr. Kim stayed with us for about half an hour to about 45 minutes. He did a great job. I would recommend him to anyone.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Lillie-May Underwood,"I've seen Dr. Savant for several years and he has always been a very good doctor. Â  He spends time, addresses all concerns and answers all my questions. Â  His office staff are always good too, friendly and very efficient.But what prompted me to write this review is Dr. Kim who I was referred to for my dad. Â  Â My dad hasn't had all that many good experiences with doctors, but claims after seeing Dr. Kim for a quick initial checkup, that Dr. Kim is the best doctor he has ever seen. Â  In Â  Â  76 years.He keeps asking me ""How did you find that doctor?"" Â  He was amazed that the doctor saw him on time, asked reasonable questions and gave reasonable answers, took notes, and gave him a reasonable care plan. Â  Â He also was impressed by the desk staff who were both friendly and efficient. Â  Â He marveled at the way all the paperwork was ready for us when it came time to go to the office desk. Â  He also liked that we were in and out within an hour - Â including Â a visit separate office for lab tests. Â  Â  Every time we leave the office he says ""You sure cannot complain about the service around here. ""I feel fortunate that my dad and I have found Dr. Savant and Dr. Kim.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Alessio Clegg,"Dr. Savant is the best primary care physician that I've ever had. He definitely has the 'whole body' approach and actually takes the time to talk to you.

Tyreese Alston,"I've been seeing Dr. Savant for over three years now and he is top notch. Â Sound knowledge and great bedside manner to communicate it.

Anisa Mackay,"Quite a challenge to find a Dr. who accepts new patients! I am very happy I found Dr. Savant and even more happy he consults in French too.

Kiaan Dale,"Dr Savant is an amazing doctor! He listens, he cares, he makes suggestions and asks questions. Â He spends time with you (instead of sending someone else in). Â He'll rush you in if it's an emergency and he always does what he says. Â Everyone that works there is extremely friendly. Â It's a small office and he takes his time with you so you have to make an appointment in advance. Â I highly recommend him.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Martyna Couch,"Dr Savant has been great. He was very personable, genuinely interested in what I came into the office for and listened to my answers after he asked me sensible questions. All in all, a great experience.Never hurts to love your job, which is what seems to be the case with him.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Riley-James Cano,Seen Dr. Savant 2x now for check ups - he is terrific. Â Very chill and thoughtful and puts you right at ease. Â He seems like the kind of doctor who is really working to maintain the total health of a patient and from our conversations feels very open to alternative and holistic medicine as options. Â You definately get the sense he is not suggesting tests and procedures for the sake of it. Â  Office was efficient too. Â Couldn't speak more highly of him.,5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Taliyah Floyd,"Dr. Savant Â is tremendous in that he is so genuine and easy to communicate Â with. Â Looks you straight Â in the eyes and really Â listens and gets Â it. Â When I told him that I was an artist he was totally interested in that part of me also. Â I am 55 years old and have Â developed Â some Â real medical challenges. Â After leaving my first appt. I felt really optimistic and dedicated to staying healthy, feeling younger Â and stronger and Dr. Savant seems to have the same agenda, quite inspiring. Â The office staff are really bright and personable and Doris well she is simply fantastic. Â In this era of money and cynicism you just won't believe guys like this are still around. Â I have seen him several more times since about some serious health issues and he has stuck with me every step of the way. Â The many tests and results can be daunting and a bit frightening but his whole office is accessible i feel like I'm going to be O.K.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Khalil Busby,"I'm very sorry to have received a notice that Dr. Savant is switching to a concierge service, but it's a no-brainer: a middle-class family cannot afford $2--3k a year just to have access to a particular doctor, on top of insurance costs and fees. There is no way for me to go on being his patient. Â Thanks for the great care you've given us over the years, Dr. Savant.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sofie Kennedy,"I love this guy! He's smart, patient, and compassionate. I read somewhere on here about someone not liking the fact that he's using his laptop during your visit...WELL on my planet that's called taking notes and that's exactly what I want my doctor to do is take notes. There's nothing worse than having to reintroduce yourself and recite your whole medical history every time you see the doctor. The front office (Doris and Sofia) are amazing as well. The only drawback is that you need to be prepared to wait like I said he's patient and compassionate, he takes notes, and he takes the time to answer any questions you have and explain whatever you don't understand meaning he may run alittle behind, but he's well worth the wait. Also, look him up on facebook and like his page he posts helpful tips for staying healthy.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Ibrahim Huffman,"I feel like I have to chime in here to counteract some of the negatives I've read. Â Dr. Mark Savant is a great doctor. Â I can see how people are upset with the direction he's moved in with his concierge practice but the reality is that he's responding to a demand for it. Â There are lots of folks who are looking for that kind of service, me included. Â When you can get your Doc on the phone for a few minutes to discuss a problem or an issue the same day, it's impossible to put a price on it. Â It's not just about an appointment the next day but it's actually feeling like you have an incredibly knowledgeable personal consultant who will make sure you get the care you need or want. The reality is that in order to provide good care and appropriate time with patients many Doctors are going to this plan. With all that said, he was my doctor before going to this route and I would have been upset if I couldn't afford to stay with him but it certainly doesn't make him any less of a Doctor, it makes him someone who realizes that he can give better care to fewer people rather than running through too many people to pay the bills. Â I have lost other good doctors because they couldn't afford to stay in business and gave up and went to Kaiser. Â I think that's unfortunate. Â I mean at the end of the day, even a Doctor, is still running a business.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Violet Blanchard,"My experience at Dr. Savant's office has been outstanding. The staff is helpful, caring, competent and efficient. Visiting Dr. Savant for a consultation is pleasant and useful. He solves problems and offers long-term advice, rather than only prescribe tests and drugs.",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sullivan Zhang,"I was treated by Dr. Kim for a very mysterious health problem several months ago. Â Dr. Kim was the most thorough physician I have ever seen, carefully tracking my results through various specialists and lab reports. Â During each consultation, Dr. Kim spent at least 20 minutes talking with me and my wife, going through my medical file, and taking meticulous notes. Â I was able to take copies of Dr. Kim's thorough notes with me to all of the other specialists, who were able to immediately ascertain where we were in the diagnostic process. Â What a great doctor!",5,Savant Wellness,"Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Una Harrington,"Went to take my wife to see Dr Savant for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised that all the reviews on this board was totally accurate. Good doctor, great personality, extremely knowledgable, straight forward, and does not BS you.

Then about 3 years ago when we made an appointment we had to wait up to 60 minutes for an appointment. Â Started becoming a habit. Saw 2 months ago and 4 patients were scheduled for same time. Â He is gone quite a bit (long weekends) we had to call back, he didn't call us. Â My husband post stroke patient and went several days for refill. Now he is offering creme de la creme doctor service. Thats supposedly why he became a doctor. Â Dropping all of us, even if we did pay to join his exclusive club we don't anticpate any changes. Â More $$$ and charge the insurance company up at the wazuuu/ Â Should have given 6 month notice.

Ava Buxton,Dr Savant is extra attentive and you can tell he cares a lot about his patients. Â He uses his laptop to take notes regarding all your concerns.

Pranav Mcghee,"Started working with Anatara in Dec 11 in order to take a more integrated approach to my health as well as trial a different treatment approach for some nagging tendinitis/overuse injuries. Over the last four months i've seen an immediate improvement in health and energy via their personalized approach to diet and wellness. While the tendinitis is still healing, I've been able to focus on strengthening and stretching as opposed to worrying about my care.Their back office function is still getting smoothed out with regards to insurance, etc but overall they are top quality professionals from start to finish.Recommended not just for people with chronic issues but for anyone who wants to unlock another 10%, 20%+ of their physical potential.",5,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"

Danielius Shaffer,"This is long overdue. Â I meant to write it in Dec. of 2019, but it was a bit traumatizing to have spent thousands without any help, support, concern from Anatara or the practitioner I saw or staff. Now I hear Colleen Galvin, PA is not with them any more and I'm not surprised. She was unhelpful and did not give me the attention a patient should have. Anatara is NOT a good place to go if you're just looking for functional medical support and supplementation - not in my experience and if it was the fault of their practitioner, they owe me my money back.First when I had my first appt., Coleen called me in even before I finished the paperwork that would give her info. she would need to know before using my one hour. Instead she used most of the hour to go through the questions then and there without allowing time to consider my answers as I would have on my own. Â The cost for an hour was very high and rather than first look at issues and use that time for talking about solutions and testing, Â and explaining the solutions, all new to me, it was about my symptom. Then she told me about her stem cell face lift she was going to get in Brazil and wanted to know if I wanted cosmetic injections. Â Huh? Â I came to a functional medicine place. Â I looked at the clock and the hour was up. Â Then time up, blood work was done and she sold me a couple of supplement right off the bat based on...well now not sure.Then I didn't hear from them for over a month. Â I finally called and asked about bloodwork since they said I should wait for an appt. until it comes in. Â They gave me an appt. for the following month..just in case, they said. When I did go in, I find out that the bloodwork had been there. Â I came in 2 months previous for help RIGHT then and got no conversation on possibilities or what I could do in the meantime. Â When I did go in Coleen hadn't even looked at my bloodwork. She started looking at in during my hour...all new to her. Â I had 10 viles of blood taken. That was too much to just glance in an appt. consultation. Â Don't doctors look at results carefully before the consultation? Â Then they have to do cross checking of results to decide on best course of action? NO, she spent all the time looking at results and then seeing other contrary results and changing recommendations. Â She didn't eve have time to discuss all the different result, but she did have time to discuss her results and what she did, trying to liken my situation to hers, but only in one result!!! Â It was SO overwhelming, much of it scary, but the hour was up. Â She sold me tons of expensive supplements with a quick long list of how to take them ALL. So many. But there was no real Â guidance on any of it. Â Out I go. As I painstakingly went through all my results as well at home, utilizing info. from internet and med. info. sites, I couldn't understand a couple of the doses and supplements. She also tried to sell me enzymes, but not understanding any of it (since times was spent on analyzing results right then), I didn't go for that. Â I wrote her to ask about doses and supplement, but I got no response a month. Â I wrote her again. Â No response. Â I got a very brief response after 2 months of my first email to her email, and by then I just took it in my own hands. Â Oh yes, I called Anatara and was told to write her again and they'd let Dr. Ahvie know. Â I hadn't heard from Anatara at all. I just lost a lot of money on NOTHING. Â I deserve my money back, but feel too upset to pursue...for now.",1,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"
Paddy Fountain,"Loved Anatara Medicine when I first started going! I was really impressed with the level of attention and knowledge that Dr. Herskowitz has. However, they really dropped the ball on my care, after spending a lot of money and really following all their instructions. I found that they level of attention and care to customers was sub-par. I wanted to continue with Anatara, but was recommended that I go with the doctor that left, rather than continue care with Anatara. Â Really feel like they could have done more for the amount of money I spent there.I would really be clear with what you expect from Anatara before you sign up for all the money and lack of care you will receive.My 5 stars have moved on to 2 stars!",2,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"

You are in a position to save people's lives and that profit margin is unconscionable. Please remedy this.

Jerome Odling,"My friend spent close to half a million dollars going here for 6 weeks in the end of 2019. I went with her, and rather than people receiving her and giving her a comprehensive program, she would say what she felt like that day - acupuncture, an infusion - it was like ordering off a menu. The treatments themselves were so aggressive, she almost couldn't make it home. Finally when we were able to fly her home for Christmas, we called Antara needing to talk to someone about the state she was in, and know what were we supposed to do. Was it normal? Was it expected? In San Francisco they told her her migraines and swelling were because cancer cells were dying. NO ONE CALLED BACK US FOR OVER A WEEK, finally we took her to the ER. Then we got a call from the Antara doctor saying ambiguous ""positive thinking"" things like he has seen ""dozens and dozens"" of cases like hers where people recovered. No medical advice at all. No one else in the world would accept my friend when she went there, so maybe her health was too dire - but Antara accepted her money - she died February 20th. Save your money and your dignity, this place is just peddling hope to desperate people.",1,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"
Chloe-Louise Lord,"I'm being treated for stage two breast cancer at Anatara medicine since August 2016. I've taken the RGCC test twice. I went through intensive IV therapy for about six weeks. At the end of the six weeks the RGCC test showed that the circulating tumor cells had reduced considerably. Currently, I'm being given high-dose IV's of vitamin C, vitamin B, artesunate, glutathione, NAC and oxidation. Twice a month. The staff has been very kind and I adore Dr. Hershkowitz and Dr. Wilson. The only thing is I feel as if there is a lack of communication and consistency regarding treatment plans, test results and follow up attention. I was waiting for them to tell me what to do and realized they have many cases. I then requested clarity and the Drs were very quick to figure out what we are doing and put me at ease. I just think that there needs to be somebody over looking the patient plans making sure patients are on target having focused therapy attention and updating patients so we don't feel so lost in our course of action. I have put my life in the hands of Anatara expertise. Time is of the essence and I feel like I'm definitely in the right place to treat my cancer humanely and one day soon will be in remission.",5,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"

Hayley Hudson,"Dr Ahvie and his team are like an incredibly well oiled holistic machine. I have been in treatment for about 6 months going thru their holistic program. I am most impressed with the fact that i get to see practitioners in different modalities (dr, acupuncturist, holistic nurse, nutritionist, naturopath, massage therapist, yoga instructor, etc) that all approach my case as a team. It is Very comforting to have many opinions on big medical issues, like the ones i am facing. I have been enjoying Korean 5 Elements acupuncture treatments, and have completely changed my diet and supplements with great results. I have successfully transitioned from a vegan to an omnivore with great advantages seen in my day to day health and joint comfort. I have learned how my choices to grow up vegan actually harmed my health over the long run. I have reached my ideal weight, effortlessly, and am slowly shifting from a state of high stress to one i can manage. I really like the entire staff. The office is light and comfortable. They have all the technology to do a variety of cutting edge holistic and medical treatments, focusing on holistic, gentle methods first. I believe in this way of medicine and have been referring all my friends and clients with good conscience. I will continue to see this team for all of my medical needs.

Michele Sharples,"Please don't go here. Â I was a patient here and they completely took advantage of me in every way.

Nelson Stewart,"For all those who are searching for better health care for themselves, the Anatara Group is worth a visit.

I am currently being treated through acupuncture, chinese herbs, Â and a personalized diet plan. I am seeing dramatic results with my weight, skin and energy levels.

As a mom of three children, I feel I am finally on the path to better health so that I can be the mom my children need me to be. I highly recommend this group of wonderful professionals.

Karson Jacobson,"If you are frustrated trying to get medical treatments that really improve your quality of life, or if you just want to go from good health to extreme vitality, this is the place for you. From the minute you walk in the front door and meet the clear blue eyes of the compassionate and competent Charlotte, you know you have walked into an unusual and comforting place. You will then realize each practitioner that you work with is tops in their field. Extraordinary. And they actually really work together on your care! Pamela is the Naturopath who has done incredible things with my blood sugar control that my (historical) endocrinologist had nothing to offer to help. Overnight (literally) she stabilized my blood sugars by realizing my cortisol elevated all night long and by giving me a supplement to counteract that. That is just one example of what she has improved, but such a major one. I completely trust her judgment, expertise and knowledge and my health has benefited immeasurably from her tutelage. Then there is Katie, a competent and compassionate acupuncturist. Spending time with her you not only get treatment with ancient Chinese procedures but you have the added benefit of feeling enveloped in Katie's compassion at the same time. Then there is Michael, the Herbalist. Wow. Michael worked with my asthma until he got the exact formula to alleviate my asthma attacks, something Western Medicine could not accomplish. I am forever grateful. Last, but certainly not least, I need to give the most resounding endorsement to Dr Ahvie Herskowitz., founder and coordinator of care at Anatara. He is brilliant. And compassionate. He also takes the time to understand what needs to happen differently for his patients to achieve optimum health. I most recently came in to him with neuropathy that my former physicians said could not really be treated. Ahvie has given my feet huge relief and has literally given me my feet back.

Dahlia Povey,"Dr. Herskowitz and all the folks at Anatara medicine were instrumental in saving my life. Â I suffered from acute chronic illnesses for quite a long time and after finding this clinic, I finally started to improve and now have my life back. Â In fact, I am enjoying life again. Â Dr. Herskowitz has been on the cutting edge of healing therapies for decades. Ironically, many of these therapies are standard practices in many other countries more advanced than our health care system. Â When facing chronic illness or better yet for preventative care, I highly recommend this clinic. Â Especially come for an opinion before taking on any radical western treatments. There may be a better and/or complementary way. This is a real post, feel free to contact me.",5,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"
Ayyub Finley,"Disappointed lately. A year of the naturopathy treatment was useful but a lot of people could have given me the same fairly standard prescriptions for a fraction of the cost here. I realized that Herskowitz wasn't actually dealing with the underlying Hashimoto's Syndrome at all, just trying to get a more precise take on the prescriptions I'm taking which have been stable (and tested) for many years. He no longer bothers to take my pulses, so he's not using the acupuncture knowledge. He is a calm, great listener but since he's getting paid $500 an hour, you can see why. My biggest concern, sadly, is that he always seems to want to upsell me on some expensive controversial treatment. First, it was chelation therapy, which has risks and is only clearly indicated for heavy-metal poisoning, which I don't have. Now he is pushing stem-cell therapy! I'm just someone who wants to be healthier. I am not dying of cancer and desperate for a cure, nor am I like Dick Cheney who wants to live forever at any cost. Stem-cell therapy is a little creepy--from whom were those stem cells taken? It is not yet approved by the FDA or the AMA and not much is known about potential side effects. In summary, I remain a fan of naturopathy, which made my uterine fibroids disappear (for which service I am grateful), but am not necessarily a fan of Anatara's high rates, up-selling pressure and willingness for me to take unnecessary risks.",3,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"

Sadia Mclean,"The experience at Anatara is amazing! Â I'm undergoing treatment for reproduction immunology, which I believe might be a little unique from most of their patients, so their customized attention has been phenomenal. Â Dr. Herskowitz, Dr. Wilson, Sarah Wanek, and all of the nurses have been absolutely wonderful, and have went the extra mile with me on several occasions. Â They have been very patient with my difficult veins, and one day while I was in the waiting room before my appointment, I had a kidney stone which was the worst pain ever, and they took such good care of me. Â I even threw up on Dr. Herskowitz! Â LOL. :-) Â I had some very sophisticated immune testing done at the Alan Beer Institute in Los Gatos which recommended a very aggressive treatment schedule of Leukocyte Immune Therapy in Mexico, Humira, IViG, etc., and I went to Dr. Herskowitz for a second opinion. Â He spent a lot of time with me connecting all of the dots with family history, genetics, infertility results, and extensive bloodworm results to figure out an integrative, more natural, modular, and complimentary plan. Â I feel amazing after the ozone treatments, and not only is it addressing my immune system, but also the mitochondria cells for my IVF egg retrievals. Â I am very interested in doing Stem Cell Therapy next, and will be using Dr. Herskowitz and his team. Â I am still in the midst of my journey, but so far my interim bloodwork results have shown positive progress. Â And I feel awesome - great energy levels. Â I'm happy to answer any questions for anyone who might want more information about my experience, or who might be going through infertility challenges as well.

For 7 years, doctors treated my symptoms and not my illness. Â They sent me home with a box of drugs and told me to stay in bed.

Jarvis Mac,"In considering our experience with Dr. Ahvie Herskowitz, a quote from Nelson Mandela came to mind: ""A good head and a good heart is always a formidable combination."" I first brought my elderly mother to see him about a year ago. Â She has degenerative lung and heart conditions that I felt could benefit from a more holistic and integrative approach. Â Dr. Herskowitz's experience in cardiology is what motivated me to bring my mother for monthly visits from Fresno to see him. Â We were not disappointed. Â After getting her extensive medical records from Kaiser and filling out a detailed medical history form, we met with Dr. Herskowitz for our first appointment for about two hours. Â He skillfully interviewed her, delving into her emotional history as well as discussing her medical issues. Â He then did a physical exam. Â From this he devised a plan of comprehensive care that included appointments with the naturopath and Chinese herbalist on the Anatara staff. Â What I can say is that instead of being on a downward trend with periodic trips to the hospital emergency room, her health is now stabilized and she has energy that gives her a good quality of life. Â For this, we are extremely grateful.I also had an unexpected medical crisis this past year that Dr. Herskowitz guided me through. Â This is a very compassionate person who cares deeply about his patients. Â I believe it is the combination of his knowledge, experience, and insightful sensitivity, along with the commitment of the patient, that can heal. Â Everyone deserves the level of medical care given at Anatara Medicine.",5,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"
Farhana Lindsay,"My daughters and I have been working with Dr. Herskowitz at Anatara Medicine for about 8 months so far to recover from multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) that we have been struggling with ever since getting sick during a kitchen remodel in August 2012. Â Under Dr. Herskowitz's care, we have made significant improvement and our ability to function day to day has been restored by the regimen he has given us. Â From our first meeting, he was determined to help us. Â He was meticulously prepared for our office visits and discussions, and was very generous with his time and care. Â I appreciate this, especially because we drive two hours to get to him (oh, and, he has offered us phone appointments to save us the drive!). Â He really ""gets"" what we have been going through, he has wonderful attention to detail and memory for our case, and he is very thoughtful in his approach and thorough in his research of treatment. Â With us, he is sensitive to the fact that whatever treatment we do must be appropriate for young children - which distinguishes him from doctors who recommended IV chelation or other invasive treatments. Â His knowledge, creativity, and skill has helped us immensely. Â Dr. Herskowitz is a stellar healthcare practitioner, always crediting his staff members for their contributions, always treating his patients as ""partners"" in the recovery process - and he actually has a great sense of humor which helps break up the heaviness of managing chronic illness. If you are dealing with environmental illness due to chemicals, mold or Lyme, or any immune dysfunction for that matter, even if other doctors couldn't help, I recommend Dr.Herskowitz and his staff at Anatara wholeheartedly!! Â Every time I finish up a conversation with Dr. Herskowitz, I thank God that he followed his calling to become a doctor because he is really dedicated and really excellent!And, thanks to Azzolino Chiropractic Neurology for guiding me to Dr. Herskowitz!",5,Anatara Medicine,"Naturopathic/Holistic, Nutritionists, Internal Medicine"

Kier Cameron,"Whatever you do do not get a subscription with OneMedical. They will do whatever they can to get as much money out of you as possible and do not care at all about your wellbeing. I had a very standard infection that should've been cleared up with a hefty dose of antibiotics. They gave me an extremely conservative dose, asked me to come in when it didn't respond and charged me $320 for a 15 minute visit and gave me a different medication, but also a conservative dose. I came back in again (and was charged an additional $320) . I had several hundred dollars worth of blood tests run on me because they thought I was immunosuppressed (I am 23 and extremely healthy).FOUR weeks later I still have the same infection. I finally gave up on OneMedical and went to another provider. They gave me an intense dose upon the first visit and I'm finally on the road to being better, no thanks to OneMedical who have now billed me $1400 for what another provider solved with a $50 copay.They don't care about your wellbeing at all and will intentionally draw out your suffering in order to make more money off of you !",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sultan Cooley,"If like to spend your own time so your provider can cut costs and maximize utilization of call center resources to improve margins, this may be a service for you! One Medical is akin to having your healthcare provider stuck behind a tech support help desk complete with a queue that will regularly leave you waiting on hold for over an hour to reach a human for even small asks. The hold music provides a single 15 second loop of the non-offensive music interrupted only by a recording that tells you how much they appreciate your patience so at least you know they care.I've had a membership for several years for my family and the experience has been really awful lately. My wife has had primary care providers swapped 6x as they leave and she gets assigned a new one on a regular basis. If you want a consistent provider who knows you, this isn't the spot. Again, think tech startup with people coming and going frequently.We had to wait 2 months for a referral because they were so slow at responding and didn't respond to in-app requests (see screenshots). When she finally got a referral, she made an appointment for a specialist and then.... Surprise! Someone from One Medical called and cancelled her appt with the specialist the night before without telling her about it. So she drove to the specialist for an 8PM appointment that wasn't on the books anymore and spent an hour there with the front desk trying to sort out what happened before having to go home with no answers (see point about insanely long call queue). This all is despite them having called her 2x the day before to confirm the appointment.She made a new appointment after going through the insane call queue again, having to wait 2 more weeks to reschedule because the specialist was already booked. The day before the appointment, the specialist's office called to say the referral is messed up and the specialist hasn't been able to get anyone from One Medical to respond to fix it (yet again, the long call queue is a killer). After waiting on hold for over an hour, the person from One Medical said that ""It's approved and totally fine"". Well, turns out, it's still messed up and so this appointment was again cancelled and she's now stuck for 3 MONTHS without being able to see a specialist for an actual health problem. To add insult to injury, we've now wasted double digit hours on hold with One Medical and driving to non-existent appointments.They've now managed to give her a new phone number to call to make an appointment but.... that number is completely wrong and goes to a different provider. I'm on my 81st minute on hold just to try to get someone to give me the correct number.

Instead, I was charged $540 for a short telehealth visit where I had simply asked for a referral to a specialist doctor. Not asking for a diagnosis at all, just a specific referral.

I complained and was refunded, and the person that I spoke with during that phase of the experience was nice and apologetic - but I've been a patient for three years and they never requested my medical records from my previous provider, or even (in all this time) ran routine labs.

They don't return insurance company request forms, they fill out the forms wrong, order the wrong tests, don't return your phone calls, don't reply to emails, act as if your stupid because they are the expert and don't really listen to what you are saying. Ive had multiple doctors talk to me in a mocking way. There is no way to call the front desk. in stead they put you on hold for :45 minutes to talk to someone across the country if they don't hang up on you once they answer. They say you can do everything through their online app. In fact they don't reply to your messages. They don't reply to request of any kind. The doctor says he's going to put in a referral for you. The information doesnt show in the app and of coarse you cant call the office to ask for the referral phone number or any other issue. The doctor never remembers who I am or why I'm there. They pack thier schedules so tight they cant take 5 minutes to read your chart or add to your chart. They really seem to just be maximizing the number credit cards they can run in a day. If anyone can recommend another GP please DM me. I've got to get out of this scam.Also, I prefer my doctors and their staff to keep their activism private and perform in a professional manor.

Faiza Downs,"I've been a One Medical member for about two years now, and my overall experience has been meh to poor.Pros:- usually able to get an appointment nearby- in-app communication (hey, I'm a millennial)- clean, modern offices (a lot of doctors' offices in SF are dingy and look like they haven't been updated since the 80s)The cons are basically everything else, unfortunately. I don't mind paying an annual fee if I feel like I'm receiving some elevated level of service. That might have been when I first joined, but it certainly hasn't been for the last year.It's impossible to speak with anyone. Over the last year, I've seen messages to the med team and the admin team within the app, which advertises a one day response time from the med team and 3 days from the admin team. I have messages from October that no one answered. A recent message to the med team had not received a response after 6 days, so I finally had to schedule a virtual visit to get an answer. You used to be able to call the office directly - now you get directed to a phone bank where you'll wait on hold for at least an hour. I've lived in a lot of countries and areas of the US, and had doctors where I _didn't_ pay an annual fee, and I've never experienced such terrible customer service.In 2019, I had a health event, and when I was released from the hospital, I was advised to go to my primary care provider for follow up care. My doctor was dismissive, misread my records multiple times, and seemed completely disinterested in coming up with a long term care plan for me. I contacted OM to help me find a new provider in the network who might be more attuned to my concerns, and they were not helpful.Due to the aforementioned health event, as well as the fact that I play a few sports, I do have to go to the doctor with some frequency.

When I called to schedule a new patient appointment, I was told by One Medical staff that in order to even get my name into the system, I would need to pay a $200 annual fee to be registered in their system. This would be in addition to my $20 office visit co-pay.In order for me to get my $10 prescriptions, I have to pay $220. $200 of that just to even exist in their computer system.

Making the appointment. and speaking with the N.P. was great she was very nice. Although I have tried for the last two hours to see a physician online to discuss a dull pain I have been having for weeks where I believe is my kidney. But I am not a doctor. Anyway tried to call customer service only to be hung up on and all my future calls forwarded to voicemail.This service along with Lyra mental health is designed for convenience which is what attracted me to the service, but this entire experience with this and my ""mental health professionals"" is just a joke. Honestly this review is for the medical professionals that work for this service...Please find a better way to serve your community because these people who run the company do not care about the patients only the bottom line.Thank you.Sincerely,-Adam Cooter",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Amritpal Berger,"Went here for a 30min visit last month with a general practitioner. He asked me some questions and did some basic checks like listening to my breathing etc, and just found out that they're calling it a ""moderate to complex"" office visit and charging me $400. Called their customer support and they told me that even though they're in-network, if I expect to do 2-3 office visits per year then I should get different insurance. This is nuts since they're basically saying that I just shouldn't go there for anything other than my annual physical, and if I have any small problems that come up that I'm worried about I should just tough it out instead of asking the doctors. It's basically just useless.I've been on the same insurance plan for 3 years. I've used Zocdoc and dignity health with this plan to see both general practitioners and specialists, in-network and out of network, I had never once been charged $400 for 30min. I asked One Medical about their billing policies and all they would tell me is that they're comparable to the other providers â",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

The only thing I like about One Medical now is that you can easily schedule an appointment with a doctor or nurse practitioner on their site or by using their app. You can see any practitioner that you'd like to see, so you can get an appointment quickly if you need one.

They have a messaging system that is suppose to allow you to communicate with them at your convenience but they don't respond and if they do, they selectively answer your questions and respond with bland pleasantries like "" let me know how things are going"" which mean nothing if they don't even read what you're sending.

Arlo Casey,They are insanely expensive. Â I went to two appointments last week and they billed my insurance about $1k for seeing a doctor for about 30 minutes total. Â No tests or anything literally just talking to a doctor for 30 minutes and that costs $1k.I truly cannot wrap my brain around that.

Finnlay Davila,One Medical is an unethical business. They have repeatedly been non-transparent about the charges.

I got an email saying they couldn't process my payment - not sure why as my card hadn't changed - and that I needed to go to my account and check it and/or make a manual payment. I did so the next day when I saw the email but was informed by the system that my deadline had passed and I would need to call one medical. I tried to call three times and left a message each time but did not hear back. The fourth time I left a message expressing my disappointment and frustration and finally got a call back. I was informed that because I missed my deadline my membership cost had increased (by 33%) and there was nothing they could do about that. Again, I expressed my disappointment and frustration, outlined the order of events, and asked for the situation to be escalated for further consideration. I was told it would be and I should expect to hear from someone the next day. I never heard back. And quite frankly I've just given up on them.

Chelsey Koch,"Horrible communication of medical billing. This medical group is only worth it if its free at your company (some tech firms do this), but if you have to sign up for the $200 membership on your own, FORGET IT. Don't be lazy. Go find a medical group and doctor that fits your needs. In their portal, they give you action items. This can be anything from the physician sending you a survey or their bogus system asking you if you need a flu shot AND IT MAY ALSO SEND AN ACTION ITEM IF YOU OWE A BILL. They have a 3rd party lab work company that can communicate with you separately. Beware of lapcorp. They will send you a bill without codes reasoning why your insurance denied the claim. On that note, one medical won't give you an itemized invoice about what part of your claim was denied unless asked. And if the source of the denial is lab Corp, they will claim they can't help you because they can't see their data. THIS PLACE IS A BOOK KEEPING NIGHTMARE. watch out for their use of lab corp america. They'll send your past due bill(which was never communicated well) to a collection agency without warning.

Carlos Fraser,"Complete scam.Heard One Medical was good from a roommate, so made a same day appointment for a brief visit. (1) didn't realize you could receive care without paying the annual membership. Website is unclear and front desk administrator told me I would not receive confidential messages unless I did. I'll definitely be asking for that back.(2) for a fifteen minute appointment with my in-network insurance, I was billed $500. Absolutely insane. I could've gone to the ER and paid the same amount.Care was okay, but nothing the doctor did would indicate that the appointment would cost me $500... he wasn't using golden q-tips or anything.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

For anything beyond a cold, the staff here is just ... bad. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some good doctors here. But the experience I've had here is just terrible.Examples:1. I got my annual checkup done and it seems like they're just perplexed as to why I want one. Well hello I just want to take care of myself??? To top it off, they seemed to dismiss any concerns I had about my health.2. Some of the staff here doesn't seem to understand women's health care and can be very rude and condescending.And because of that, I will never come back to one medical.

Mac Parsons,"I really don't have high expectations for a PCP. Treat minor conditions and refer me to a specialist if what you are treating me for does not improve or requires a specialist. That's really all I expect but somehow even those low expectations were not met.By the time I got to one medical I had already been in the ER and been prescribed something so the doctor told me to just proceed with that medication. Great, makes sense. A week and a half later my symptoms are flaring up again so I decide to email the doctor on their app. I told her the situation and asked her do you think it is caused by ""x"". She responds no but offers no other alternative. Does not suggest I come back, we try a different medication, or I go see a specialist. Weird, but I guess I didn't ask the question. So this time I ask her ""ok what do you suggest I do?"" She says ""well you could go see an x specialist but I don't think it's that."" Great so if you don't think it's that why would you suggest that? She also said she didn't need to refer me to anyone because I have a PPO insurance.So at this point I've wasted 3 days emailing and gotten zero useful recommendations. I can google things on my own but the reason I'm asking her opinion is because she went to med school and I did not.After doing my own research and realizing the doctor is not going to help me I decide that I should see a gastroenterologist and not the other doctor she said probably won't help (thanks for the tip on who not to see LOL WTF) I find a place that takes my insurance and call them. They tell me I need a referral because they don't take people without them regardless of PPO insurance. At this point I want to bang my head against the wall because I have to go back and talk to Dr Helpful. She agrees to give me a referral after I'm the one that did all the research. How nice of her.Honestly I feel like I should get my $20 copay back. All she did was tell me to follow the ER doctors instructions and when I went to her for guidance she did not provide any and I had to manage my own care anyways so I wasted a few hours of my life and $20 when I could have just booked my own appointment with gastroenterology and had someone at the ER refer me.I called one medical to try to speed up the referral and a nice receptionist suggested I go try a new doctor while my referral goes through so I don't have to manage my own care. That's nice of her but I'm probably just going to throw away another hour and another 20 bucks.I just feel bad for all the people who need medical help worse than I do and have to navigate through this BS.

Charmaine Berry,"There is a lack of responsiveness and responsibility that borders on the negligent during a public health crisis. As evidenced by it taking one medical a day to do something that takes other health clinics minutes to sort out, and an inability to see how and where the service is lacking followed by an attempt to sift responsibility onto the member.I called on Saturday to make an appointment for a COVID19 test and I asked if a test could be provided for my wife who was a member previously. I was told that there is a way to for her to get the test as well and that someone from membership would call us on Monday.Alley from membership sent us an email over the weekend and called Monday morning. A call that we missed. We were unable to speak to her for the rest of Monday.We called back and spoke to Peaches in membership who told us it could not be done without my wife being a member. We asked why we were told otherwise by Alley. Peaches said we would have to ask her, but she was in a meeting and that she'd call us in 40 min. Then Peaches hung up on us.2 hours later-We called again and spoke to Jay who told us that Alley went to lunch because it was the law that she had to take a lunch break. This seemed needlessly defensive as if reprimanding me for infringing on Alley's right to lunch, when I simply wanted to know when I was going to get the answer. Â Jay then proceeded to try to dodge providing service by asking for a release form from my wife. Luckily she was right there and could speak to him directly. Jay past us to Simon who works in admin to do ""triage and screening"" words we are unfamiliar with in a medical context and that the customer service team could not take the time to explain. Simon said someone will have to call us back and when we said we would hold on the line because Alley had still not returned the call till then, that was when he hung up on us. At this point in the process we had had to explain the story to Alley, Peaches, Jay and Simon for a total of 98 min on the phone, with nothing to show for it. My wife has insurance she was even a member before and they made us feel like we were asking this big favor to allow her to be included in this privileged experience that is one medical. In case this all seems acceptable to the reader let me juxtapose the one medical experience with what we eventually did. We went online and found a local clinic called All Care at 3:15 pm (while I was still on hold with Jay). We scheduled a phone consultation within an hour. Sent them our insurance card via email. Spoke to a pleasant doctor at 4:20 and scheduled a drive through COVID test at 6 pm.Why am I paying $200 a year? I completely understand if One medical does not want to test non members, however promising a member that it could be done and then passing them from one agent to another for an entire day, is not the way I would like to be treated. I've been a member since 2014 and I'm sorry to see this end on such acrimonious terms, but it must end after this experience, Â because I value my time and health I will no longer be member.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Monica Cartwright,"Very disappointed with the billing, with no consistency on how they work their pricing. I had a general visit of 15 mins for a cough/cold. Was happy to get in the same day appointment. They 'accept' my insurance, and when I get the bill in my email it's $359?! With my co-pay of $159. Just doesn't add up! I checked the pricing structure in their website, and there is no single fee close it my $359 billing. Something is really wrong. I get the service and ambience part, but they have to be upfront with what they are charging their patients for. Who pays $359 for cold and cough! Never would have gotten the membership for $159 had I known this scam. Soo disappointed!Update- didn't have an option but pay the bill. They called me back, made zero sense on what they were trying to explain on why a general visit bill at a place that accepts your insurance would come to $159.

Bryony Simmons,"I've had positive experiences with One Medical - until now. I pay the $200 a year to be able to get quality care quickly from top notch doctors, but for the last week I've continued to struggle to get care following an ER visit. Â Don't want to call anyone out, but I do want other patients to know what they're getting/not getting. Â I got ill while out of town and ended up in the ER. Â I was advised to follow up with my primary as soon as I returned home which I tried to do but she was unavailable so I saw someone else at One Medical. I was experiencing extreme vertigo and nausea and the doctor agreed it was urgent so he immediately referred me to a physical therapist who could do a manuever to relieve the vertigo and allow me to walk without assistance.Obviously nobody checked to see if the physical therapists actually do this maneuver because when I called they say they don't. Â Definitely something the doctor could have checked on ahead of time vs. leaving it up to the very ill patient to arrange. Â Then I got a referral from One Medical to an ENT doctor for the following day. Â While I was able to see that doctor, there was yet another barrier to care - a hearing test they need to do to rule out another cause of the vertigo. Since no one notified me that was necessary, I had a very inconclusive visit with that doctor. One Medical set me up with an appointment today with my primary, almost a week after the ER visit. Â I went to that appointment at which time I was advised, ""oh you didn't get a message? The doctor is out this week"" Apparently they had called an hour before my appointment to cancel. I've now been scheduled for another appointment with my primary next week. I hope that appointment happens. Â In the meantime, I've been online finding videos of maneuvers I can do to relieve the vertigo. It's the only relief I've gotten post- ER... the help I gave myself. Super disappointing experience that would make any patient feel helpless and alone.I've asked for a full refund on the $200 membership fee since One Medical is not providing the service they describe. Will update this post with whether I get it.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Klara Olsen,"I'd been with Kaiser for years and started a job where it was not offered. I muddled through what was a really awful search for a new provider until a coworker recommended One Medical. This location is literally across the street from my office and I was able to make an appointment to meet immediately with the NP I chose. The office is clean and well maintained and very well decorated. A boutique feel. I was impressed by the care I received from the NP, the lab techs were REALLY on top of their game, and the ability to make a video appointment and have a prescription filled while I was traveling was incredible. During open enrollment, my employer was able to switch me back to Kaiser and I pretty much resigned myself to writing off the $200 annual subscription I paid to OM. I sent a simple email to member services to inquire and received a nearly immediate response that included a generous prorated refund for the remaining subscription period. MIND-BLOWING!!! If I were not so embedded in the Kaise ecosystem and I did not get so much from it, I'd definitely consider defecting to OM.

Demi-Lee Whittaker,"I really do like the physicians, NPs, PA-Cs, etc. that I have seen through One Medical, and I do appreciate the fact that I can make or cancel an appointment the same day. Â But what I initially thought was a fluke in their prescription authorization system turns out to be a consistent problem. Â I take a medication that is a controlled substance. Â I go through one bottle of 30 tablets at a very low dose in about 3-4 months because the prescription is ""as needed."" Â I used to be a member at Kaiser and while Kaiser had the same, no-refills policy regarding controlled medications, I could always go online and request a refill and be assured that it would be ready for pickup within 24 hours. Â With One Medical, I waited a full week for my prescription to be authorized the first time I requested a refill.This is now the second time I've requested a refill, and the second time that the pharmacist and I have had to call multiple times after several days to get someone at One Medical to authorize the new prescription. Â I requested the prescription on Sunday and it is now mid-day Thursday. Â It's frustrating because I really do need this medication on occasion, and I have a 15-year documented history (there's some kind of controlled substance database) of not abusing this medication.

Adelina Nunez,One Medical used to be 5 stars. It's not anymore. All the old friendly staff is gone and so is several doctors I've visited. They have huge staff turn over which is frustrating as a patient to have to re-explain medical issues to a new doctor every year. For my specific situation I'm taking a medication that has been well tolerated for several years that requires blood work every 3 months. They're now requiring me to have an appointment every 3 months to discuss said medicine even though at the actual appointments everything is fine. My old doctor there only required an annual followup and even said that my blood work was so good that he'd feel fine if I did it every six months. This just feels like a money grab to bill my insurance provider unneeded office visits.,1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Percy Nguyen,"Many problems with the doctors here. They can't or won't diagnose one of my problems. I have wasted probably 20 hours trying to get treatment and ending up with nothing more than lousy referrals, lost faxes, endless hours on hold, wasted trips, extra copays, just for that problem. (Thanks, Natalie :-( ). That problem is easily treatable if treated promptly, but require a physician to treat Â  (individuals who are not physicians are not allowed to purchase certain medications). I am also suffering from an injury. Bodhi Anderson, PA-C onemedical.com/la/physicâ¦ ""The only thing that can cause loss of lordosis is a pulled muscle [long explanation of pulled muscle]"". I attempted to quickly factcheck Bodhi and asked him to please be patient. Bodhi did not wait one second before he said in a raised voice that he had been doing this for 20 years and that I could go elsewhere for treatment, and then hung up. Not only was he incredibly rude, what he said was not true:-- Other causes of flatback syndrome include the entities listed below:Degenerative Disc Disease: [...]Vertebral Compression Fractures: [...]Ankylosing Spondylitis: [...]Post-Laminectomy Syndrome:[...]Apparently several causes of this condition but I could not find where pulled muscle was one such cause. The reason for my call was not to get into a fight. I called because I had been to Veronica Jow that morning to ask for assessment of my condition and a strategy to transition back to my normal active life. I didn't get that this morning. Veronica said that I could ask another provider about it. But I wasn't asking for her permission to go elsewhere! I was asking her what was wrong with me and what to do about it. I had to press her many times for this and each time she did not answer. Then, she said that the time was up so I had to leave the office. Also, I didn't get her doctor's report after the visit. I didn't get any suggested follow-up, either. I called in to One Medical, to ask about that morning's failed appointment with Veronica and how I still needed a plan for recovery. I was told that I'd get a call back from them within two hours. I waited patiently, but didn't get the call within two hours and so I called back and then the receptionist told me it wasn't two hours yet, and then slipped that it had been over 2 hours. Why she wanted to fight about 2 hours with me when I'm simply calling in to get treatment and following up on a call I was expecting, I do not know. Then she told me to wait a minute. I waited several minutes before being transferred to Bodhi. This is just one example of the sorts of problems I've had here. They seem nice, but when the doctors can't treat me they should not get frustrated with me about it!On the plus side: 1) the office is really nice, 2) the receptionists are usually very nice and clear-speaking when I call or visit, 3) Appointments are on-time. They seem to be seriously trying to have a better referral process, but it is still awful. The doctors are also mostly stupid. Sorry, but it is true. Â reason.com/blog/2007/01/â¦I am leaving this as 2 star in hopes that they have a doctor who is committed to health (rather than simply doing their job and billing the insurance companies for a yet unresolved condition). As for the lost 20+ hours of my life in wasted time, I won't get that back :-(.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Stanley Vazquez,"I have been a member of One Medical since October 2015. I had a great experience with them until I scheduled a visit with Dr. Andrea Powlen and had to deal with One Medical's billing department. I was billed $419 for a less than 1 minute visit with Dr. Powlen that wasn't even necessary in the first place. She asked me to come once every 3 or 4 days for follow up visits and I am so glad I never went back. At $419 per visit, it would have been thousands of dollars without having the slightest clue that I was being billed for the unnecessary visits.

Patsy Whitaker,"One Medical is a third-rate middleman with nice waiting rooms. They do not have any in-house medical expertise. They do not have any relationships with actual medical providers. Anything beyond a flu shot is going to require a referral. The admin staff will send you a message with Â some random service provider's contact info, who maybe won't call you for a week, and if you call them, they tell you they have to double-check the insurance authorization and they'll call you. Then they'll say the earliest available appointment is more than a month out. So you'll contact One Medical again, and they'll send you the next referral on their list within a day or two. Sometimes you'll finally get an appointment, get to the office, and be told the provider you have the appointment for doesn't accept your insurance, only a few doctors in the practice do and this isn't one of them but One Medical didn't bother to check that. And they don't have any available appointments for (wait for it, literally) more than a month anyway. Lather, rinse, repeat. When you do get care, it'll be some place that only has appointments available because no one wants to go there, e.g. a physical therapist's tech/assistant who conducted the assessment on the wrong hip and then gave me 30 days of exercise which they said, this won't help the problem, but you have to do it to get the insurance to allow you to seek other treatment. If you have a concussion and vertigo, it's still going to be all on you to navigate this process. They will never follow-up to check on your condition. The nurse practitioners you'll see who will trigger the referrals will all be super nice, and the techs that do the blood draws are skilled at painless needle insertion, but you will not actually get any treatment for any medical problem.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Beauden Lowe,"I've been a patient for about 18 months and have seen a steady decline in care with a steady increase in costs. It is a shame because the premise is good, but the practice is terrible. All my favorite MDs have left for greener pastures in private care, as One Medical has promised so much to them, yet failed to deliver.{The company has great branding but fails to live up to its brand promises...}While the 45 minute appointments can be great as I do feel ""heard"", the productivity that comes from these meetings have been limited to ""prescribing"" supplements or very expensive compounded products - neither of which are covered by my insurance. Â Too much time is spent documenting my symptoms (CYA?), so much so that my MD apologizes every time I see her. Such is the current state of our medical system who fails to recognize that MDs need time to SEE their patients instead of staring into a computer screen.Anyway, most of my successes have come from consulting with a L.Ac outside of their system (and not covered by my insurance), then getting blood tests to verify the diagnosis and follow up tests to determine progress. (Oh, and One Medical just started charging a fee for blood draws, the nickle and diming is getting to be a bit much.)I'm currently looking for a new East Bay PCP Â and won't be renewing my ""membership"" with One Medical.

Sid Southern,"This review is about the One Medical business, which came highly recommended. I called in ahead of my first appointment with questions about my insurance and billing. When I showed up for an appointment to get a repeat prescription I was told that I could go through insurance and pay $300 (!) or pay a reduced $175 up front. Under pressure I chose the $175 option. I then called my insurance, and got the full story. Insurance companies have contracted rates for different visits. It doesn't matter if the doctor bills $300 or $10,000 as the contracted rate is what's paid by insurance and then relayed to the patient.

Rahim Heath,"Just had my first appointment with One Medical.Before my visit with One Medical, my idea of a doctor's visit was this: 1) arrive 10 minutes before appointment 2) sit in the waiting room for 35-40 minutes 3) go to the patient room 4) sit for another 10 minutes 5) nurse comes in and takes vitals 6) sit for another 15-20 minutes 7) finally doctor comes in and spends maybe 5 minutes with me.At One Medical, this is what I experienced this morning: 1) arrive 10 minutes before appointment 2) doctor picks me up from the waiting room, exactly at the appointment time 3) spend 15 minutes with the doctor 4) I'm outAlso, I was able to get a next-day appointment booked easily thru the website (could have been same day if I went to a different branch).It's a game changer.Also it's pretty nice that the office is well furnished with some soothing (and choice) music piping through the Sonos speakers.

Like with anything medical you do, make sure they're covered by your insurance before you go. They're in network for me and I found their billing to be a breeze.

Now I pay a yearly fee, besides my insurance, and for that additional fee I expect just a little bit more, instead, I have received a whole lot less. A buzzer goes off while I'm being examined after 15 minutes. The Doctor types the notes while I'm there as though it is a part of the 15 minute window. It is a model I am not fond of. They push you to conduct business online, which I detest. You cannot reach the specific office where your physician is, but are routed to a central office. No continuity, and no knowledge of who you are dealing with. Healthcare is a business, I understand that, but the human aspect of it is paramount. I am waiting for a referral that thus far has taken 3 phone calls, all to different assistants, and one call to my insurance, which informed me no one has contacted them in regards to a referral.

Kiyan Knox,"This review is for the experience that I had at One Medical Group's 110 Sutter Location: I tried out One Medical Group at a time when I was new to SF, quite ill, &amp; in desperate need of Medical Care. I had insurance through BCBS but did not have a Provider/PCP &amp; was not sure where to go so I looked them up on Yelp, saw some good ratings &amp; reviews and decided to give them a try. This was my experience.It was a horrible choice &amp; a regretful terrible route to have taken. A sorely poor choice I made to give in to OneMedical. It was almost like jumping through unnecessary hoops or taking a pointless detour to access medical care. They were very quick to sell me the Membership &amp; did everything they possibly could to convince me to join, &amp; sell me their services. They wanted that money - $150 for a Membership. They were advertised perks such as on time appointments, a stylish waiting room, &amp; they seemed very keen to have me. From the moment I rang them, I felt as though I was being sold something, it was like ringing up an exclusive health spa or Gym. They were fabulous on the phone &amp; sounded so exclusive &amp; glamourous. It was JUST like being sold a Gym Membership, or calling in after seeing an exclusive Advert on QVC with the Agent waiting right next to the phone prepared with a script. Walking in to their office was like visiting an exclusive health Spa, or Real Estate Office.. It felt fake, like it lacked authenticity, it absolutely did not feel like a doctors office.After visiting reception &amp; paying the Â£150, I was sat down at a computer where I would pick out my PCP just by looking at faces, a brief summary about them &amp; their qualifications, a guide with their location of office/clibnic based on neighbourhood preference &amp; convenience. Then there was the Membership Fee, OF COURSE, which they insisted I pay before they would provide service. A Lovely Membership Fee - only Â£$150 to join &amp; become an 'exclusive member'. Just as if I was joining a Gym indeed! I observed a few things right off the bat. First the staff at reception were not dressed appropriately at all, certainly not for the Medical Field. They looked like they were working at a H&amp;M, Forever 21, or some Health Spa/Gym sort place - they had pearcings, crazy hair, and looked casual, cool, though quite informal. They ought to have been wearing scrubs, a uniform, name tags, and something a bit more presentable, which is what I would have expected that being they are a Medical Office. But it seemed ok because of course One Medical is not your typical Doctor indeed. I selected a female PCP cos I felt that I'd work better with a woman. She looked lovely on the computer screen but even after I chose my PCP when I went in to see my selected PCP she wasn't even the person I had selected! It turned out the PCP I selected was on Maternity Leave, &amp; I wasn't even notified at the time I signed up! A Nurse Practitioner saw ne instead (Nurse Tatum I believe) - I didn't even recognize &amp; her appearance made me feel very uncomfortable. She was dressed more like a Bank Teller or Real Estate Agent, she had no name tag, and wasn't even wearing a white coat or Medical Attire. It made me feel uncomfortable, like I was in the wrong place, and was not what I had expected. As for the medical component, I was incredibly ill with a cold when I went in I knew exactly what kind of Medications that I needed cos I had empty bottles from Meds I had previously taken that I was prescribed. I had a sinus infection &amp; needed refills on a few medications I had previously been taking which was the reason for my visit. I was unwilling at the time to compromise, I just wanted to feel better, so out of desperation I went forward with paying the $Â£150, despite all of these observations that had indeed turned me off. I accepted the fill in Nurse Practitioner that had called my name instead of the Doctor that I had chosen on the computer. The medications she prescribed me were not what I was seeking or had wanted. I only got 3 out of the 5 that I had requested &amp; for my Sinus infection instead of prescribing me antibiotics she told me to go buy some nasal saline pot from Walgreens! Absolutely absurd &amp; ridiculous! i should have just gone to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care. I was so horrified that I never followed up with her or did anything. I was so displeased that I never even went back, but of course I got lots of bills in the mail! I feel like One Medical Group is geared towards a specific type of cliental, &amp; turn their back on others needing more specialized care. They are definitely exclusive &amp; not open to just everyone, which is one of the reasons they sell themselves with a Membership. I have since moved on to UCSF &amp; I'd recommend going with CPMC, Kaiser, St Francis/Marys or even SF General instead. I would not recommend One Medical Group to any of my colleagues.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

They had not let me know about the price of the first visit so I went a second time making my bill a total of $800!!!!!Not to mention when I tried calling to work through all this with the team they were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. They offered me a ""50%"" discount (making the total bill $400) which is ludicrous and begs the question why the visits are so expensive in the first place if they can mark it down that much.

Dalia Simmonds,"I am sitting in the office of One Medical offices on Sutter street having a truly awful experience. I just spent fifteen minutes with a PA who who asked me what medications I take, probed my jaw with her fingers, and looked into my ears with a lighted scope. She then confirmed that yes, I do have TMJ and there's nothing to be done about it except keep taking Ibuprofin. When I went out to pay my co-pay, I was told that it would be $100 usually, but since I was a new patient, that would be $150. I balked, because a couple years ago I paid $140 for an uninsured appointment with CarePractice that was twice as long, included tests, and sent me home with medication. The receptionist told me sweetly that of course they could try putting it through the insurance, but there was no way of knowing how much it would cost then, except that it would most likely be considerably more. Probably $300 to $500. Or I could pay $150 now. ""Let me make sure I understand you: I have to give you $150 now or you are going to charge me an unknown fee, probably somewhere between $300 and $500? For fifteen minutes?"" ""Yes, that is what I mean.""""That's crazy.""""We don't know what the insurance will say.""""Can you call the insurance?""She goes to call the insurance company. I get on the phone too, but my hands are shaking, so I'm still winding my way through their automated system when the receptionist comes over and shows me a figure. It's $789 She explains this is the highest the insurance company pays for that code, and it could be as much as that. In other words, I can give her $150 now, or find myself with a bill for $789 later. Take it or leave it.The insurance rep, when I finally get through, gives me a guestimate of $78.68. This sounds a lot more reasonable - I realize medical care is not cheap, but a $300-$800 range for chatting with someone for 15 minutes is pretty crazy. There is no way I would have come in if I'd known it was going to cost that much. Apparently, I'm not the only one facing this problem. There have been several disagreements during the half hour I've sat here with patients telling the receptionist that their insurance companies have told them that they shouldn't have to be forking over these large sums in the office, that One Medical should be billing the insurance companies. The receptionist always sweetly insists that they pay.Eventually, I call my wife who comes over and bails me out by telling them we'll just put it through the insurance company and work it out with them if the charges turn out to be outrageous. But I still leave the office in tears. There's really no reason, IMO, why I should have to choose between forking over $150 (for a $78 procedure) immediately or face a bill of several hundred dollars. I gather the reason why I was pressured into making a decision on the spot, without access to information or time to think it over, is that it's easier for One Medical to get money that way. I can't stop comparing my experience here with the one at CarePractice, where I was handed a binder upon arrival that very clearly spelled out all the procedures available and how much they cost. In fact, they put their fees right up on the web, for everyone to see: carepractice.com/feesThey also don't charge a $150 ""annual fee"". I didn't mind paying the fee when I signed up yesterday. But I thought I was buying protection against an experience like this.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Alexandre Vaughan,"SO incredibly frustrating. I've had three different experiences with One Medical and they've all been headaches, from doctors blowing me off to randomly cancelling my appointments with no prior notice. None of the staff seems to communicate with one another. It's a shame, I love the theory of OM but it's being carried out in a terrible manner. I keep trying to give them chances but at this point I'll be headed elsewhere when my membership expires.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Vihaan Baker,"I had a 15 minute appointment with Dr Elizabeth Maier from ONE MEDICAL.I arrived and she told me ""I only have 15 minutes, I hope you know that"".I had an order from my cardiologist for an ultrasound (liver, upper abdomen) I wanted her advice on where I should have it done. She told me that she couldn't give me an order for an ultrasound. I told her that I had one, gave it to her. She looked at it. She said she couldn't give me an order. I said I didn't want one, I just needed to know where to go. She asked me why my Doc didn't tell me where to go, I said I didn't know. She asked me what I wanted from her. I said advice on where to go, that I thought ONE MEDICAL was a concierge service to help me. She said she could look up a place (we are 5 mins into the 15 min meeting at this point). She pulls up Health Diagnostics and I call them (from her office), she tells me after 2 mins ""can you do that outside, I am busy."" Now, I still had 8 mins left by my count. I left. She was a completely unprofessional from the time I walked in to the time I left. I was concerned with the fact my Doc asked for a liver ultrasound, she showed no care/patient concern at all - concerned with her issues, her situation.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sonnie Torres,"I am new to One Medical, was very excited about their concept on Medical Care. Â Part of what I found exciting was that I could communicate via email with my doctor and possibly avoid taking time from work to go to the doctor. Â I was wrong. Â I've seen a lot of posts that people had problems getting a Primary. Â I did get one, in my network my first appointment. Â That was about as good as it gets. Â After my first visit I was sent to Physical Therapy. Â I sent the doctor an email asking a question, no response. Â I called One Medical, asked if I am allowed to email or if I needed to get approval or something. Â The Receptionist said the Dr's are busy and will get back to you when they can. Â I got a response 4 weeks later. Â After a few months of Physical Therapy, the therapist told me to go back to the Primary as there is an issue she cannot resolve and wants me to see another specialist. Â I went to see the Primary, she sent me in for blood work. Â Got the results via email, Primary was copied. Â Sent 5 messages asking what my next steps should be .. come back to the office, more test etc. Â That was 3 months ago, no response. Â I sent an inquiry to the general mailbox for One Medical, no response. Â I also thought it strange that the Primary spent the whole appointment sitting behind a computer. Â I got a lot of ""oh, that sounds terrible""; ""wow, you must be uncomfortable"" ... I do not want soothing words, I want medical assistance!! Â The worst news is I was going to go back to my previous doctor (even though I do not like him, at least he follows-up) and I just got a voicemail from his office telling me he joined One Medical --- UGH!!!!! I am posting here because in my desperation to find a solution I found these reviews. Â While I am pleased that I am not the only one struggling with One Medical, I am equally as disturbed that so many people have had similar issues.

Willie Bass,"Something to know about One Medical. Their billing systems are from 1989 if not earlier.

When I call the insurance companies they don't have any claim from One Medical. So I call One Medical about this, they say they will research it and get back to me.

Tea Trevino,"For quality medical care, look elsewhere!I have been a member of One Medical for years and have just ended my toxic relationship with them. Â Things they have done in the past include:1) Taking the wrong amount of blood so they were unable to test me for certain diseases2) Charging substantial amounts for what seemed like routine tests with absolutely no notice that they cost extra3) More misdiagnoses than I can countIf you end up actually being able to get an appointment with a M.D. or a D.O., you've hit the lottery. Â Even if you do, expect the doctor to be rushing you and giving you all sorts of crazy advice. Â I once had a skin problem and after a number of visits, I was finally able to see a doctor. Â He told me the solution was ""to grow a beard."" Â (Note: When I went to a doctor outside One Medical Group, a doctor was able to instantly tell me what was wrong and the condition, which I had for months, quickly went away and never returned). Â Really, this isn't a service to see doctors, it's to see nurse practitioners who have very little bedside manner and are, at times, downright rude. Â Writing that, I don't know why I stuck with them for so long. Â Today was the kicker, when I had an important appointment, and I received notice a few hours before that the nurse I was going to see actually would not be able to write a prescription I needed. Â This is after confirming on the phone when I made the appointment (since it, as always, would be with a nurse practitioner) that the nurse would be able to help me. Â Perhaps just as bad, the nurse I was speaking to, Mara, kept pointing out how long we were on the phone every few minutes as I desperately tried to find a solution to being misinformed about my appointment.If you want to pay $149/year to be treated badly, get misdiagnosed, and have your appointment changed hours before you're going in, this is the place for you.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Â I said, ""you don't know what you're billing me for, and you're asking ME to figure it out?""Then finally they ""apologized"" for billing me incorrectly, but I really wonder if they would have caught that if I just paid (which I likely would have done because I'm busy.) Â I bet they would have kept my money. Â What a fraud.Then to be treated so rudely just because I am calling about THEIR mistake was beyond the pale.

Nicolle Gutierrez,"What a brilliant concept! Affordable, friendly, humane and dare I say...inspiring health care. I walked out of here with a spring in my step, I was so utterly thrilled with the whole experience.My coworker had told me about One Medical Group's system - you pay a yearly membership fee ($149), and then can utilize any of their SF clinics. Sounded unusually easy. See, like most 20-something year-olds, I don't go to the doctor to check on my health...I go to the doctor when I'm on the edge of death, desperate for drugs and educated answers. And as we lax youngins know, doctors don't like last-minute appointments. In fact, I have always ended up in Urgent Care because it's easier than begging my doctor to squeeze me in.But with One Medical Group's snazzy, patient-oriented set-up, the minute you have symptoms (or a week after you've been suffering from some unknown infection) you can just hop online to check available appointments, book it, and you're good to go. I booked an appointment the very next day! They have multiple clinics in SF, and the office atmosphere feels so clean, modern, and stylish - totally unlike those gross, sterile, lifeless doctors offices we're used to. They've got sleek furniture, stacks of cool mags, and...get this...fabulous music (they were playing Lykke Li, Beirut, and The Knife during my visit - where the hell am I? This is too good to be true!)Ok, but I haven't even gotten to the good part yet. The doctors! I picked my doctor, Amber, online, based on nothing except the fact that she looked nice. And boy, was my intuition correct. Amber has such a calm presence, and really listened when we were chatting about my medical history, concerns, etc. I felt immediately at ease, knowing I could be totally honest and that she was actually paying attention to what I was saying. So un-doctor-like. In fact, everyone here from the receptionists to the lab techs to the nurses are super cool, and they seem like they actually enjoy their jobs. That's the key difference.I got my lab tests emailed to me within 4 days. Everything was so streamlined, efficient, and high-tech that I'm almost excited to have an excuse to go back (almost).

Cadi Wilde,"I may not sign up next year and this is why: - A lot of (mostly?) non-MDs- Not a lot of specialization: * There is one sports injury doc and it takes 6 weeks to get an appointment.

Jakub Byrd,"I've been a member of One Medical for two years now. I haven't had any serious medical issues, so I really haven't had a strong opinion of the services it provides, until now. This changed today when I got a message from my primary care physician that she is leaving her practice at One Medical. She recommended that I change my primary care to a nurse practitioner in the One Medical Office, which I found strange. Why would a Medical Doctor recommend Â a nurse practitioner to replace her? I called Blue Shield, my medical insurance provider, and I was told that Blue Shield does not allow nurse practitioners or physicians assistants to be chosen as primary care physicians, so even if I followed the recommendation of my PCP to go with this nurse practitioner, Blue Shield wouldn't allow it. Anyway, I would rather have a medical doctor Â as my PCP. So I went on the One Medical website to chose a new medical doctor that Blue Shield has in its network. I was surprised that all of the One Medical physicians in San Francisco are waitlisted, so the only providers available are nurse practitioners and an extremely limited number of physician assistants. I called One Medical and asked the representative how I was going to chose a Primary Care Physician when none are available. The rep said that I would have to be waitlisted and it could take anywhere from six months to as much as two years to get a medical doctor as my primary care physician. He said that until that time, if I should require medical attention, I can make an appointment with one of the nurse practitioners. Â Although I like the idea of One Medical's services of providing same day office visits, I find it strange that One Medical has an extremely limited amount of actual physicians. At the time I joined One Medical I didn't mind paying the annual fee because my Primary Care Physician was an actual medical doctor that was board certified and accepted by Blue Shield insurance. I really liked my doctor and it is unfortunate that she is leaving One Medical. Now I find myself at a crossroad wondering if One Medical Services are worth it if no medical doctors are available anymore. There definitely appears to be a decline in the level of their service if One Medical can't attract any physicians to meet the needs of their clients. As I stated, I like the concept of One Medical and I really hope that I can get a Primary Care Physician like the one I had before. The idea of waiting years and years for one to become available is not acceptable to me nor should it be to any of the other One Medical clients. One Medical might be a good option for someone who doesn't mind placing their care in the hands of a nurse rather than a medical doctor. I don't see this as being an issue for minor medical issues. But I sure would like a doctor around for more serious issues. Especially if I am paying premium for the service and the fees increase yearly.",3,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

If I booked an appointment, I only see the provider I booked it with--they take my height and weight and lead me to the room. It cuts out having to wait two times before seeing the doctor. I love that each patient room has a desk with two chairs. They are strategically placed so that I'm never sitting across the desk from the doctor but rather diagonal from them. I appreciate that I'm not expected to immediately sit up on the table and that the initial conversation always happens when I'm sitting in a normal chair. I know these are small things but they make a huge difference.For women's health exams: She had me step into the area with the exam table and closed the curtain that divided the room in half, so she never actually left the room while I changed, she just was on the other side of the curtain. I appreciate not having the awkward knock on the door with them peeking in to see if it's okay to come back in. Also, the gowns are roomy and made of a soft fabric with snaps every six inches to close it. The gown I was given was leopard print.

Jadene Wilkinson,"This review is for One Medical Group in general. Great for BASIC, GENERAL CARE. I think the focus on customer service &amp; their use of technology (website, app) Â are what makes One Medical a true gem in the industry and an innovative company. They streamline the process if you need an appointment by giving you access to the calendar of all the doctors in the area, and you can even get a prescription written for you via e-mail (if it's minor). This allows for a myriad of possibilities, and the likelihood of getting an appointment when you need it (often day-of or the next day) is actually a possibility. Most other Medical Companies I have dealt with are extremely inefficient with this, and do not pay attention/care about the patient's needs. OM's e-mail support team is always on-point and punctual. Â I've had nothing but great experiences with One Medical. Like everyone has said, the yearly fee is worth every penny.The only downside is that the sheer amount of people on staff does make it a double-edged sword. One thing I would recommend is making a relationship with one particular doctor or smart PA if you can (they do not all know what they're doing, and some will judge you or make assumptions about you). The amount of doctors available is appealing but it can be hard to get someone to truly understand/ not judge you for what you're feeling.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

I fell down my stairs and they sent me to the right string of doctors due to my complaints that led to them finding a cancer that would have surely killed me if it had not been found when it was. I am alive today because of them.The ongoing care they gave me over the following two years was unparalleled in any doctors office I have ever been to.Sure UCSF/UCLA or some other massive facility would give you care if you can find an available doctor there. What you're paying for here is a guaranteed same day visit in a major metro area. It seems like a good deal to me......,5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Esme-Rose Rollins,"Bait and switch. Â After signing up online and paying their annual fee, I found out that no, there are no same day or even same week appointments available.

Rachel Hilton,I found one medical to be Terrible healthcare. The one good thing was the no wait but I was rushed out in 10 mins exact even though my appt was meant to be at least 20 mins because the doctor had somewhere else to be and on top of that the doctors there were googling answers to my medical questions - I was getting them answers by emailing other doctors I've seen in the past. Not thorough and more like the fast food of healthcare def not quality and certainly not knowledgable information - so disappointed I cancelled my membership,1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Nafeesa Churchill,"One Medical Group has a decent offering, but it's OVERSOLD. Real ""concierge"" medical practices often cost upwards of $500 a year for membership, and offers services like a doctor being on call after hours, responding to your emails, etc.One Medical claims to offer all of this for $149 (less if you have a coupon or are referred by a friend who has a coupon), with a snazzy office to boot. Surely, they're cutting corners somewhere, right?They are.Let's start with the promise of email access to my doctor. My doctor used to be a Dr. Singh at the 110 Sutter office. Over the course of my 1st year of membership, I emailed Dr. Singh 3 times. I received 1 response over that time, and it wasn't from Dr. Singh, it was from a physician assistant who works at One Medical. So strike one - you don't truly have email access to your doctor.Second - continuity of care? Dr. Singh left One Medical with exactly 1 week's notice. 1 week's notice! After being my primary care physician for 18 months, I got a mysterious email stating he was leaving One Medical at the end of the week to pursue an interest in ""corporate health"". Log in to the website and find another doctor... that was his advice.My prediction is that One Medical will eventually farm out everything to inexpensive PA's and nurse practitioners, and you won't be able to see a doctor. That's already pretty much the case. I since moved to a PA after Dr. Singh left, as it's hard to schedule a visit with an actual MD. Not that I don't think PA's are capable of most of what an MD does, but sometimes you want to see a doctor, and One Medical used to provide those...Nonetheless, I'm still giving them 4 stars (I'd love to give them 3.5 but that's not an option) because: a lot of other clinics in town will force you to see a PA rather than an MD (it's an industry-wide thing, you see, to save on costs), and being able to make appointments online AND request prescription renewals online is worth the $149 annual fee.Just don't buy into all the hype, because as with any other deal, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Real concierge medicine isn't cheap, you pay for what you get.",4,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Madiha Mclellan,"I do love the One Medical concept and I really, really like my doctor so I am sticking with them and him, but I had a not so great experience with the billing department. Â First off, you should know that if you have a high-deductible plan and you haven't met your deductible, One Medical gives you the option to pay $100 for any standard office visit on the day of, rather than bill the insurance company, but that $100 does not count toward your deductible. Â I had a few appointments in 2013 and when I went to leave, I was not asked to pay the $100 and instead was told ""okay, you're all set"" so I figured they somehow changed their policy. Â Nope. Granted, I should have asked about it and admittedly I did not. Â One Medical ended up billing my insurance for 4 different office visits and a few months later I received a bill in the mail from OM for around $1,000. Â I called them to see what was up and what it boiled down to was that they sent claims to the insurance company and whatever the appointments were for weren't covered, so basically I am paying $600 ($1,000, minus the $400 for the visits) as a penalty for the inconvenience of sending claims to insurance that didn't get paid. Â I can understand charging some kind of administrative fee for the trouble, but it's pretty draconian to charge that much over the $100 pay-on-the-day option. Â  I called to complain that this cost was a little excessive so they agreed to knock down the bill a little, which was cool of them, and I agreed to pay some of it, which I did. Â At some point early in 2014, after payments had been made, I was told that the entire bill had either been waived or paid and that no further amounts were due. Â But at a recent office visit, the front desk person said I had an outstanding balance of $300 and change. Â When I told her I thought everything was settled, she said she'd check with billing. Â Billing called me today and said that the amount was due and when I said that the last conversation I had with billing ended with them saying that we were square, the response was ""sorry, there's nothing we can do about it at this point but we can set up a payment plan if you'd like."" Â Super annoying. Â The girl from billing was very nice about it, but I'm pretty pissed about having to fork over more money when I thought the bill was settled.So five stars for my doctor, five for the one medical experience and two stars for billing - nice people, but not so nice penalties for denied claims.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Tevin Kaye,"I love One Medical. I've been to two different offices in SF and both were great. I was able to make a last-minute appointment online.

Garrett Weaver,"I had my first visit as a new client this past week. Â Honestly, I wasn't blown away by the service from the staff but it was prompt.

Â  Â - Sarah Maxwell was the PA-C I met with. Â She was easy to talk to and helpful. Â I hadn't gone in for checkup in over 5 years. Â  Â - They have an on-site lab (on the 2nd floor) which is convenient.

Â I have a PPO, and each time I've gone in to One Medical, I've walked out with this feeling like I needed a second opinion. Â It's turned out that every single time I've gotten a 2nd opinion, she's been completely wrong. Â Some redeeming qualities: Same day appointments. Superb administration and customer services. Â If you want a decent diagnosis, skip this group.

Aj Vance,"There are some great things about One Medical. Nice offices. Easy to get appointments. On time. Easy refills. Everyone is super friendly. Excellent practitioners of medicine? No.Their roster of MDs is super junior. Some bios don't mention board certification, which is insane. The level of turnover at the MD level is crazy high as well.Run of the mill stuff, they are mostly fine. Anything seriously wrong with you, and that is when you wished you had a relationship with a real physician practice. One of the weakest parts of One Medical is that the practitioners also seem to have terrible referral networks. I don't mean official insurance referrals; I mean a dr. knowing a roster of specialists locally who they know are good physicians and feel comfortable referring patients to. I am in a PPO, don't need referrals to see specialists, but used to ask One Medical simply because I thought they would know good doctors. I could not have been more wrong.And please don't be fooled by some of One Medical's responses here to complaints. On the issue of not having admitting privileges - that is a big deal, and being able to ""work with any hospital"" is NOT the same thing.As for the $150 fee, if they take your insurance, unless they have an insanely unusual agreement with a given insurance company, they actually are NOT allowed to charge the fee. They got into major trouble with Brown &amp; Toland over it a few years ago. They are not even supposed to ask for it, and you most certainly do NOT have to pay it. The way they charge and justify the fee is super, super slimy. Lastly, I hated that practitioners would shake your hand when they greeted you in the reception area. In any other setting would be nice. In a doctors office full of sick people? Gross. Who knows what sick people that hand has touched.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sumayyah Haley,"It was like a scene from a horror film. In the shower, blood splattered EVERYWHERE. Except instead of being stabbed to death, the source of all the blood was my nose. Yes, projectile bleeding at its best. It was getting EVERYWHERE [No exaggeration, but I have no pictures to prove this...], and I was trying to clean as I bled to my near-death, naked in the shower...I hadn't experienced anything CLOSE to this since '98 in Brussels when I had to stand over the hotel room sink while my nose ran like a leaky faucet. The bleeding only stopped after we ran down to the bar downstairs to ask for some ice. That, and I was probably low on blood by then!You want to scare the shit out me? Well, this would do it. Would I not live to see week two of 2008?! Would I collapse in a pool of blood with the shower running above and blood-splattered walls around me? Would CSI realize that I hadn't been murdered and that I had instead died from a very bad nosebleed? For a moment, I thought I should perhaps write ""NOSE"" on the wall - a final bloody clue to the mysterious death of moi. It was barely clotting when I was able to hop out of the shower, conditioner still in my hair, trying desperately to keep pressure on the nose. Scary. Luckily, the bleeding stopped after about two hours of applying pressure and just sitting there. Very carefully, I washed the conditioner out and grabbed some lunch too. To be on the safe side, I emailed MMG with a brief description of my ""problem."" I had signed up in October after reading Cherie's review of one of the doctors there and had not actually made an appointment yet. Within minutes of sending my email, I received a response. I could possibly be squeezed in for an appointment in the same afternoon! While I chose not to go in on the same day, imagine my relief when I got such a prompt response. Somebody cared!Perhaps I WILL make it to week two after all...------------Part of 1Life Healthcare, the practice is ""designed to be accessible, responsive, reliable, convenient, trusted, education-oriented, and holistic and integrative.""

Mahira Keith,"This is by far the worst quality of care that I've had since I was in an HMO network (Kaiser) over 10 years ago. I will not return. I called early Friday morning, after learning of the group's promise to get you in to see a doctor for a same-day visit. I was told that the group could not see me until Saturday at 5:45pm. So much for guaranteed same day appointments (a primary reason the group requires a $150 annual membership fee). Later on Friday, I was called and told that an opening was available for Friday at 5pm. When I got to the practice, I was seen by a Physician's Assistant, not a doctor. During the visit, I explained my condition. The PA asked to send in some lab work. The website says the offices can do lab work on site, which is another reason to pay the $150 membership fee. One Medical sends lab work out to Lab Corp. It takes 5 to 9 business days to get the results back (if you ever get a doctor to call you with the results, that is). It is also debatable whether it is 7 business days maximum or 9 days, it depends on which nurse is telling you, since I was told both.When I told the PA that I was recently on a prescription for the same condition (only a month earlier), and could not recall the name of the antibiotic, she could not name a few of the common antibiotics generally prescribed for the condition. She actually took out her smartphone and tried to google for the name. She then told me, ""I don't have time for this. I have to see another patient."" One Medical claims to require the $150 membership fee so that you get extra time with your doctor and quality care. I did not receive this.Fifteen minutes after I left One Medical's office, I called back with the name of the antibiotic. By Saturday at noon, I tried calling One Medical because I had not heard anything from them and had expected a prescription to be called in to a local pharmacy. When I called in, I was transferred to a voiceline and put on hold for over 20 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone, I was told that no one was available to speak with me at that time and that ""someone would call me."" Nearly two hours later, when I still had not heard back, I called again. I was again told by an automatic system that all lines were busy and I was placed on hold for nearly 25 minutes. When I did finally get through, I was placed on the line with a nurse who was unfamiliar with my case. She said that the PA had written in the file that I was going to ""pursue holistic options"" rather than an antibiotic. While I understand the benefits of ""holistic options,"" and believe these are valuable, when I have a persistent bacterial infection that requires an antibiotic after more than a month-long bout with the infection (and twice before on an antibiotic that didn't rid me of the infection), I expect to be put on a stronger antibiotic, and maybe add to this the benefits of ""holistic options."" I in no way would walk out of the medical office with the intention of ignoring the need for an antibiotic.The prescription was finally called in about 6pm on Saturday, more than 36 hours after I had initially called about the condition.On Wed, after not hearing from anyone at the medical office about lab results, I called to speak to someone. Again, I was placed on hold. Again, I was eventually connected to someone that had no clue about my file. I was told that lab results would take 5 to 7 business days and that someone from One Medical would call me before the end of the day Thursday. By 5pm Thursday, I had not heard from anyone. I called One Medical. I was again placed on the phone with yet another new person who was unfamiliar with my history, poor and frustrating experience to-date, Â and was clueless about what was going on and asking me again from the beginning what was happening. Additionally, she told me that no records were in my file about my email communications with the nurse from Saturday. Another ""benefit"" that One Medical claims is worthy of the $150 membership fee is email communication with a doctor. I have yet to speak with a doctor. And, even after I emailed the nurse, no mention of that communication was put in my medical file.The nurse I spoke to today (Thursday 5:20pm) said that she doesn't even see a record of my tests being sent to the lab. So I'm waiting for nothing. They didn't even send out the samples to a lab on a persistent bacterial infection that is now on a third round of antibiotics?! This place is incompetent, at best, and at worst, could lead to a malpractice suit. I would avoid it at all costs.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Bonita Reid,"I'm a substitute teacher and I have to update my TB test every year and to get to my regular doctor is a kind of a hike, so I thought why not sign up with this new group that is super close to my house - I live downtown. Â  So I pay the $100.00 and I fill out all of the info. online just so I can go have Â a TB test done and read. Â So, I make an appt. with a Physician's Assistant (PA), named Jennie, and she takes me into her office and gives me the test. Â My first reaction was that I felt like I was the first person she had ever given the test to, and in my mind I was wondering if the way she had administered the test was going to leave a lump, which reads like a false positive. Â That is EXACTLY what happened 2 days later when I returned to have Jennie read the test. Â So, she sent me for a chest x-ray - O.K. - she's just doing her job, but it was a big pain in my - you know what, but I did it. Â I asked the technician who did the x-ray if he could send them that day, because it was a Friday, Â and he said that he would and he did. I know this because I called the office and spoke with Stephanie, a different PA, and she emailed me a copy of the x-ray and the results and they were negative - they were normal - I did not have TB. Â Nonetheless, I didn't hear from Jennie, so I was still stuck. Â  I can't file to be a substitute in the city w/out the proof of a negative TB test. Â  On Monday morning I call in to see if I can finally get the proof I need and once again, every time I call they have no idea who I am or how to spell my name (just annoying). Â  The girl on the phone had no idea what to do so I said just have Jennie call me or send me proof of a negative TB test. Â By 1pm I had heard nothing, so I decide to walk over and not leave without this .... well, that didn't happen. When I arrive, the girl at the front desk still doesn't know who I am or how to spell my name - ANNOYING!!!!! Â is it the same girl or not I wonder? Â So I explain my long story to the girl, with a blank expression on her face, and end it once again by asking to speak with Jennie. In the meantime another woman comes out - Â and comes to the conclusion that I need an appointment - UGH!!!!!Finally I catch sight of Jennie and I grab her and plead my case and she says she doesn't even know if the results have come in yet :( I was crushed.  I tell her that the results are in and that I have a copy that I received on Friday morning and that they're normal. Â  This ends with her telling me Â she has to get back to me, because she's busy with patients and will ahve to look at the x-rays later :(Who knew getting a TB test was so difficult.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Archer Roman,"With a new job, came a new city, and with a new city and job, came new insurance and new doctors. We already had our health insurance, so I was a little uneasy when they told me I would need to pay a $149 membership fee annually to use my chosen PCP as my.. PCP. I asked, before committing, if I could request a refund should I dislike whatever I was about to go through. With a refund happily promised, and an appointment made for three hours after I became their patient, off I went.The clean and quiet office had its own floor, and the receptionist was pleasant and skipped any sort of meaningless questions or chitchat, as I had taken advantage of their online health information forms. They knew what they needed to, and that I was there, and, perhaps most refreshing of all, I didn't need to pay yet. Not until I had been seen and was happy.My doctor got me five minutes late, but she had had to run to another floor to help someone with something urgent. I believed this, because I watched her go and return. Anyone else who entered the office was seen exactly on time, so I didn't mind waiting a few minutes, and I wouldn't mind waiting again. Come on, five minutes. Five minutes, past the actual scheduled time, and then I'm with my actual doctor.. not just seated in yet another room by a nurse to wait fifteen more minutes.My appointment itself was pleasant, and covered way more ground than I ever thought possible in the thirty or so minutes I was there. I got medicine! and tests! and referrals! and!.. she was happy to do all of them! She was friendly, honest, straightforward, helpful.. the list goes on.This was my first visit, and I was thoroughly impressed. I'd been extremely mistreated for higher prices up until now. I can't believe I hadn't been shown this place sooner. $149?I know this how the business -should- be, but if you factor in how much time you'll save here, versus elsewhere, and how much more convenient it is.. well, hey. My last doctor prescribed a medication to me that I was allergic to. Twice. Once after I called him and asked him if he was sure that's what he meant to prescribe. It took me three weeks to receive one of three referrals from him, and it was to the wrong doctor. After coming here instead, well.. I'm still alive, I feel better, and my needed referral was in my inbox before I left the office. Take my money.

Kaden Forrest,I always had great experiences with these guys until I ran out of a critical medication. I called for a refill mid-day and got an email at 6PM that night that I needed to come in for an appointment before they would do so. At that point it was too late to come in and too late to go anywhere else. I called back and explained the situation - that I was out of a critical medication that I need to take as a result of treatment for Thyroid cancer. I should add that this medication is available over the counter in most countries outside the US. They ended up calling in the wrong dose to a pharmacy that was nowhere near my location once it was ready. I called back the next day and they were unwilling to do anything. This is exactly the kind of BS you use a service like this to avoid. Zero effort to work with me on a realistic solution for the problem other than come in for appointment which I don't have time to do in the middle of my work day.

Jeanne Stamp,"So sad. Â I loved this place before, but I've had three really troubling experiences in the last two weeks that have convinced me that I have to look elsewhere for care -- which is a huge hassle!

Â The receptionist told me, I kid you not, that my only option was to go to an unaffiliated urgent care facility. Â She would not put me in touch with a doctor. Â Amazing, given the amount of money one pays to be a patient here, but I was willing to give it another shot given the huge hassle involved in switching.- A week later, I asked for a prescription to be refilled -- a prescription that I have been on the entire three years I've been a patient at One Medical, without interruption -- and a physician's assistant writes an email to me with a bunch of questions and calls their records on my prescription history ""mysterious.""- Then, I pick up the prescription, and it was called in wrong.

Inayah Woodward,"After several visits to the Metropolitan I've learned that it operates in the same manner as most of the medical folks that I've seen in the past. This disappoints me. Given the positive tone of the yelp reviews I was hoping for more. Like the others, the Metropolitan will force you into the role of aggressive self-advocate. Two examples I encountered: *Doctor Temperament* I visited a Doctor who has a shame-based approach to medicine. You have condition x..are 20 pounds overweight..require a prescription? What kind of woman..San Francisco native..human being are you? So, no, I will not do the right thing and schedule another appointment with you to follow-up on my issue. On the other hand, I've visited professionals at the Metropolitan who are perfectly professional and pleasant. The burden is on all of us to separate the wheat from the chaff. Â *Billing* The cost of visiting Doctor A at the Metropolitan is the co-pay, thanks to in-work insurance. The cost of visiting Doctor B at the Metropolitan is a substantial fee plus co-pay. Why? After 30 minutes on the horn, I was told that the ministry of insurance has never heard of Doctor B. Back on the horn to the Metropolitan for a ""re-bill"" and around we go...

Â I called a few places all of which were either 1. closed or 2. booked for days or longer. Â Then I called Metropolitan Medical Group.

Carole Marshall,"I pay enough in health premiums that paying another $100 annually to get access to the medical group seems a bit much for me. Â The other thing that has put me off is that I have yet to see a real doctor each time I've visited. Â Granted a physician's assistant is a step up from a nurse practitioner, but it's still not a medical doctor. Â I'd rather pay $100 to see a real doctor.On the plus side, you can get same day appointments rather easily. Â I haven't had some of the problems that other one-star reviewers have mentioned like waiting in lines out by the elevators. Â I did, however, experience some of the billing craziness mentioned by at least two other reviewers. Â I got double billed for my co-pay. Â I paid while I was in the office and received a bill again from their office after my insurance paid. Â I called their accountant who is offsite (most likely a freelance bookkeeper) who told me that ""oh they sometimes 'forget' to credit your account for copays."" Â That's pretty irresponsible in my mind. Â The other issue is that after paying a copay, I only have an electronic credit card receipt. Â They don't offer written receipts for copays that one might use if you have a 457b plan, for example, and want to get that paid through your pre-tax medical payment system. Â Instead I have to wait for the bill to come (30-60 days later) to submit it to my 457b plan.Overall I don't feel as if the service is worth $100 and I don't plan to return.",3,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Marsha Schmitt,"This place rocks.I came back from a road trip to LA this past week and the next day, I felt pretty off. Â My throat was feeling funny and my sinuses felt drippy. Â I just felt drained. Â Plus it didn't help that I ran errands in the rain on Sunday without being properly bundled up, so whatcha gonna do. Â I went to work the next day and still felt off. Â Grr.Today I got up and didn't feel worse, but was like what the hell is going on. Â I hope it wasn't the swine flu!!!! Â I mean there are 4 cases now in SF. Â So I opted to stay home and sleep because my sleep was thrown off too. Â I rang the doctor's office after my additional 4 hour nap to see what they said.I told the person who answered the phone what was going on and she asked if I wanted to speak to a nurse practitioner. Â I said sure and she transferred me to Tiki. Â Or at least that's what I think she said. Â Either way, it wasn't your average name. Â I spoke with her and she asked me the usual swine flu stuff, like had I been to Mexico or been around anyone who had, did I have any vomiting, diarrhea, fever, etc. Â I said no. Â Phew!She said it sounded like my body was just adjusting to having traveled, especially after doing a road trip for 7 hours. Â She said it sounded like an a slight upper respiratory infection and just to take a day off or 2 to rest up. Â She suggested to just take some ibuprofen, drink lots of fluids, do sinus rinsing, rest and chicken noodle soup!If my symptoms changed or I got worse to give them a call. Â So I'm swine flu free!!! Â Now, I'm yelping, just had a bowl (er, can) of Campbells tomato soup, a big bottle of H20 and the TV on a marathon of the Real Housewives of New York.

Michelle Sinclair,"I almost don't want to write them too good of a review because I don't want the MMG to get crazy crowded and I'll never be able to get an appointment! :) But this place was great. Â So happy with my first visit here. Â I saw Dr. Singh today for a physical, hep B shot, and DM51 form filled out. Â He was patient, thorough, and kind. Â Really took his time going through my detailed and lengthy family history as well as giving me a complete examination. Â I felt he truly did have compassion for me as a patient and was dialed in to my concerns. Â Also, that (government, ugh!) form I needed completed was a 6-page bear, and he went through it very tediously and ensured each section was filled in properly. Â I felt very well looked after, and also was pleased to note how friendly and helpful the reception staff was. Â They found the two forms I needed for school and faxed them for me, in addition to making sure they were filled out properly. Â Overall, what a great experience! Â It is such a pleasure to find a nice family practitioner in the city. Â We moved from NYC and I have had some AWFUL, rushed, impersonal and just plain bad dr.'s visits where you truly feel just like a number and a $$.

Daryl Iles,"I picked Dr. Lee out of a hat (or a physician directory) when I started my health insurance plan, but I never had any dealings with him or his office until I had an unfortunate incident with the Caltrain tracks on Townsend and my bike. Â I was worried about my nasty swollen wrist, so I went to the Acute Care center at UCSF. Â Long story short (and for another review), I ended up seeing one of Dr. Lee's partners, Dr. Jade Schechter, at the Metropolitan Medical office.The receptionist in the office was super nice and patient with me, even though I was less than nice, frustrated, and crying for much of our phone conversation. Â They gave me an appointment for a few hours later, and Dr. Schechter was really, really great -- she checked out my arm, sent me for x-rays, and everyone was on top of the insurance situation and told me the info I needed to know.Since then, I've been back for annual checkups with the PA-Cs that work with Dr. Schechter, and they are both really great. Â I've also been able to email them for prescription refills and non-emergency questions, which is incredibly convenient.I'll admit that I was a bit wary of the ""annual service fee"", but honestly, the office is really nice and conveniently accessible via BART and MUNI, the Internet/email compatibility is cool, the same-day appointments are great, and the doctors are friendly and knowledgeable. Â And I'm kind of into the whole vision behind their group. Â So, just this once, I'll abandon my cheapskate ways. . .after all, it is my health, and it also just might mean I'll never have to go to ""Acute Care"" again -- which is a very good thing.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Christiana Cassidy,"Why this practice is worth $149/year on top of what you already pay for your insurance and your co-pays?How about: Â same day appointments? Â Email and phone access to your regular medical staff which saves you unneeded trips in? Â Several office locations and excellent care at all of them?I've been to this place for everything from regular check-ups to muscle to bone to infections to flu to you-name-it. Â I've gotten referrals on a number of serious issues including my PA insisting on making me an appointment with a specialist (in a case where 95% of medical practitioners would have been dismissive of my symptoms to begin with) - it turned out to be something unlikely but serious (I'm 100% cured now!).They ask me about my experience with doctors they refer me to so they can update their notes!They spend the time with each patient to actually treat the person, not the symptoms you happen to remember to mumble to the doc in 3 minutes you get elsewhere. Â They seem to enjoy what they do. Â They actually have meetings where they discuss interesting/educational cases with each other - imagine that!I'm home with a fever and a bunch of prescriptions today, feeling better after a weekend from hell and here is how I got an appointment: Â I emailed around 9pm last night asking for a first available appointment and to call me whenever they got the message. Â They phoned me as asked at 7am offering me 8:30, 9 or 9:30am times.

Sidrah Buckner,"My brief, yet unfortunate, experience with One Medical Group has left me crawling back to Kaiser. Ironically enough, my main issues are the exact items they seem to dote themselves on as being ""different"".Sutter location:Upon joining One Medical, I was told that email is the preferred method of communication with the providers, yet don't receive responses to emails until about a week or more after my emails- and when they do respond, they simply are saying to ""feel free to keep increasing the dosage"" of medication. I'm wondering if they simply have email response templates. I've had prompter responses and more personalized care from both La Clinica and the Berkeley Free Clinic.While the delayed response and lack of addressing my specific issues were disturbing, I was not ready to quit them just yet...until this morning. I emailed Dr. Mary Lowen yesterday, letting her know I thought I had a sinus infection. Given the week or more response time to my previous emails, I thought I would call as well to follow up. When I called, I spoke to a very informative and courteous member admin, Brandon. Brandon let me know someone would be calling me to prescribe antibiotics and confirmed my preferred pharmacy.I received an email from them instead, with links to blogs about sinus infections. I responded to the email saying I am requesting antibiotics, not links to blogs. I was told by Phebe Kiryk that they would not call in the meds. She went on to cite recent trends in treating individual symptoms of sinus infections. I let her know that I was already sick, going on 2 weeks, and need MEDS, not data points. She told me that I would need to make an appointment to come in and be qualified for meds. I let her know I had gone home sick from work, and would not be schlepping out into the city to pay a co-pay, be seen, and MAYBE be given meds. My concerns were met with more robotic responses: Research shows that antibiotics don't always work as well as we used to think Â they did!!! No sense of urgency was expressed at all, and my concerns to advocate for my own health were discredited by Ms. Kiyrk's seemingly ambivalent coined responses.

Edan Clements,"I used to love this place. I paid the membership fee, but let it lapse as I haven't been to the doctor in a year. When I went to make an appointment, I was pressed for the membership fee. I said no. Then I was transferred to a membership associate to ""answer my questions."" I was then cajoled and shamed to pay the fee, or sign the waiver. I was asked how much I make a year. // Â I had seen an incredible doctor there who recently left OM. Now I'm wondering if their new policies are what pushed her out. When I asked the new doctor a question, she said, ""That's no longer in our current model of offerings."" Sounds a lot like corporate speak to me. I guess this is what happens when a for-profit company gets into the medical care business. Â I understand that they offer technology which is current to modern standards, but shouldn't this be the norm?? They said the membership fee pays for that. I countered that ""Why didn't the $475 charged for my 20-minute visit cover that and a nice profit margin. Â It's a shame because I have really liked the service up until now.

I just emailed the office to see if a cancellation and refund was possible. According to the time stamp, it took them about 8 minutes to refund my credit card. Nice!

Jeremiah Cross,"Having been a relatively sickly child, teen, and college student, I've seen my share of doctors. Â I can safely say that One Medical Group is the best set of doctors I have ever had the privilege of seeing, hands down.Fortunately, since I've moved to San Francisco, I haven't had any extended illnesses. Â Which, I admit somewhat guiltily, is kind of a shame because I finally have a place I know I can go to get speedily diagnosed and treated. Â I want to watch them do their thang!I had a routine checkup with Dr. Margit Djikstra several months ago, in which she was friendly, informative, approachable, and frank - all things I really appreciate in a doctor. Â She gave me a handful of ways to improve my health without making me feel like I was probably about to die if I didn't take her advice, and I left with all of my questions answered.There's also an OB/GYN in house, making One Medical a fantastic source of one-stop shopping for the ladies. Â Oh, and nutritionists. Â And acupuncturists, if you're into that kind of thing. Â That's not even the best part, though! Â Though the doctors I've met do stand out as being wonderfully friendly and competent, I've had some good doctors in my life. Â What really continues to blow me away, however, are the staff. Â They're the nicest, most helpful staff for a doctor's office I've ever encountered. Â When I had trouble with my insurance company, they helped me out with a smile. Â When I showed up for some tests I didn't end up needing, they waived my copay. Â They're really outstanding people, and I kind of want to give them some kind of medal.And I guess what it comes down to is that One Medical Group makes doctors' appointments easy. Â They make renewing prescriptions easy. Â  They make scheduling easy. Â They make billing easy. Â They make finding a location easy. Â And on top of that, they make it downright pleasant! Â So as glad as I am that I don't get sick that often anymore, it's a huge relief to know that if I ever find my health compromised, there's an easy and pleasant way to get myself back up to snuff.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Keeleigh Hackett,"I really like One Medical Group. I have had a recent string of medical issues and they have been on top of my case every step of the way. I have been referred to a number of specialists and where they lack, One Medical has picked up the slack. For instance, filling out family medical leave forms. I needed them filled out and turned into my HR department by a certain time and my Vascular doctor was taking FOREVER. I emailed my doc at One Medical and she had it done and faxed to my HR that afternoon. I also had a bit of an emergency with some meds where the same doctor lagged to send the authorization to my insurance and once again i emailed my doc at one medical for help and she was on it and got my meds in time. I really like the accessibility to the doctors, you can call or email them any questions or concerns you might have and they get back to you soon. They are general medicine docs and can refer you to great specialists. I really like that fact that they care about what happens to you and your health. I also like the fact that their administrative staff is smart, nice and totally competent. I've been to a few offices where the administrative staff is lazy, dumb and just don't care. That's not the case here. In my opinion it's totally worth the $150 annual fee. I've been with them for about 4 years and really have no complaints.

Ava-Grace Muir,"I usually don't write a review unless it's of the two extremes that I feel so compelled to leave one. So here's my extremely negative review with One Medical GroupI had an appointment with Sean Dunn (I think he was a MPH or something, not MD) at 5:40 pm. I was sick and had a major headache and booked for a ""brief visit"". I admit that I was late to the appointment so I showed up at 5:51 pm ( yes, I checked the clock). I don't see a single patient in the office so I thought I was going to be their last patient. Well...guess again. I walked to the counter and the clerk proceeds to tell me that ""the remaining time is not enough to diagnose a headache"", which puzzles me more because it took him another 4-5 minutes to have Sean Dunn to come out and repeated the same thing "" sorry, we think headache needs a complete diagnosis so we don't have enough time for it today"".Out of curiosity, I asked him if he really needs to take off at 6 pm or is there another patient coming in, he then replied "" yeah we are just trying to wrap everything up and go"" and then he said ""usually headaches diagnosis needs AT LEAST 20 minutes (does it or does this count as Â a ""brief"" visit I scheduled for I don't know).""So here you have it, I was turned away by a healthcare professional who needs to ""wrap everything and go"" when there are no other patients waiting and leave the ONLY patient he has in the office with the big headache he comes in with.I am not sure if this was in their code of ethics or what, but I believe doctors were educated to help patients and to save lives? How can you turn away a patient when there's obviously no other emergencies (as evident by the chit chatting I heard from the office and Sean came out 5 minutes later) and he was only late by 11 minutes when you are still in the office?",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Â Love It!Turns out I do need surgery on my foot...my doc gave me 2 great referrals for foot specialists and followed up with me.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Ray Greene,"I've been going to Metropolitan for a while now and am pretty darned happy with them. Â I first went to a wine and cheese reception, when did Kaiser ever do that?All the people from the front desk to the professional staff are friendly and seem happy to be practicing medicine. Â I never have a problem getting in to see my doc, Dr. Lee (who calls me dude). Â But if I do need same day I can always get an appointment, just maybe not with him. Â Seems realistic to think he might be booked for the entire day. Â Fact is I will see someone.The lab thing was pretty disgusting, those folks over on Polk run something out of the third world, but when I discussed this my doctor they started having ""in house"" lab work.All in all this a great place with great people.

Sarina Sumner,"By far the best doctors office ive been to. Modern, clean, organized, friendly, up to date with technology and bills instead of getting typewriter stuff in the mail.

Aedan Knox,"Metropolitan Medical Group is great. Â I Googled looking for a internal medical doctor/family doctor and found them. Â At first I was a bit skeptical because they had fees and I thought why pay these fees if I have health insurance... It was worth it. Â The facility as a hole is very nice. Clean and everyone was/is very friendly. Â I really enjoyed my experience here. Â Metropolitan Medical Group is a boutique practice so they provide you with more then some other doctors can. Â While on my visit, I saw Gabriella Cardi, PA-C, MHS. Â She was very friendly and nice. Â She listened to every single thing I had to say. Â She was very concerned and wanted to make sure I got the best care. Â She wanted to make sure that every question I had was answered. Â Gabriella spent her time getting to know me. Â I felt very comfortable with her.I highly recommend the Metropolitan Medical Group for friends and family. Â Especially if you work in the financial district. Â It is convenient and easy to find. Â They also have several locations to serve you which is very convenient as well. Â All in all, a great experience!",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Rahul Nolan,"One of the best doctor's clinic experiences I've had in ages. The offices are bright and clean. The front desk staff were helpful, upbeat and welcoming. My appointment started right on time with Dr. Singh and he took his time getting to know my detailed medical history and prescription medication history before jumping into any diagnosis (a problem with so many poor doctors). He suggested several forms of treatment from conservative to aggressive and listened and considered my input into the options. He was thorough, efficient and super friendly.I've also been to the clinic for acupuncture and again the service and experience was top-notch. Jeannie ensured she understood everything about me before starting treatment.I'd recommend Dr. Singh and Jeannie Bianchi without question. Both are caring, compassionate and highly skilled (things that are increasingly hard to find in medical professionals).I really appreciate and love the ability to make, change or cancel appointments and refill prescriptions online. Plus you can visit any one of their locations, which is great as one is near my apartment and another is near my office!One Medical is more than worth the $150 a year. Highly recommended.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Paolo Ellison,"I've been a member at One Medical for three years. Â But no longer. Â Yes, they have same day appointments. Â Yes, they have water and nice chairs and current magazines. Â What they seem to lack is the ability to appropriately diagnose illness. Â I have been misdiagnosed no fewer than three times by three separate providers since I've been a member. Â Yes, I had to wait two months to get a proper diagnosis with another medical provider but after four months of run around at One Medical, I'm still ahead there. Â My most recent misdiagnosis lead to a four month recovery for a finger injury that should have taken 6 weeks with proper diagnosis and treatment.

Roman Cresswell,"I was a little wary of the membership fee at first, but those feelings have completely vanished after experiencing their high level of service. Â It is definitely worth it. I have made multiple last minute appointments and they always manage to squeeze me in. Â They're always Â punctual, which is a definite plus since I'm limited to short trips out of my office. Â The service is always friendly and helpful, even when I have tons of annoying questions. Â  Â Plus, my doc responds to my email questions, which saves me the hassle of making unnecessary appointments. Â The service is great for busy people like me.

Â One Medical is a vastly different experience. Â The online appointments make them super convenient and I was able to get an appointment on short notice without hassle. Â When I got there the people were super-friendly and I was seen without delay. Â The doctor was professional and efficient --- he listened to what I had to say, checked me out, and within a few minutes he had a prescription faxed off and some natural remedies printed out.

Taiba Downs,Going to a regular doctor will never be the same! Â The Metropolitan Medical Group is worth the $99 annual fee. Â $99 is cheap considering what you get in return.

Elize Wilks,"Like a number of the other posters, initially I was a bit leery of the membership fee (I believe its $150). But I will say that the service I have gotten from One Medical (formerly Metropolitan MD) has been 1st rate. The facilities are clean and its awesome to have access to your doctor via email. Other pluses include the ability to schedule same day appointments and almost everything is paperless. Recently they have introduced a few extra on site services like lab testing which makes things really easy. And if you arent able to get your test done after your doctor's appointment, you can just walk-in and get it taken care of anytime, without the need for another appointment. They will either call or email you with the results, depending on your request.Lastly, my main reason for recommending this group is that my doctor kicks serious a$$. He is on his game in terms of knowledge about treatment, prescribing drugs etc. As the son of a medical professional, I know what separates a doctor from a good one and a great one. Â My doctor here is great. Not to mention he also knows who I am and takes notes during the appointments and re-visits any issues that I've had/asked about from prior appointments. If you are in the market for a doctor and live/work near the financial district, this place is definitely worth checking out.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Frankie Whitley,"I've been to this office a couple of times now and it's terrific. I've seen Dr. Charlie Burns, who has been attentive, thorough, friendly, and who definitely put me at ease. He also shared my lab work via email and has been accessible this way, which for me is a huge plus.Their online appointment process is terrific; I've been able to make a same-day appointment and one for several weeks in advance (why don't all doctors do it this way!?). The office atmosphere is calm, professional, and efficient. The *only* reason I don't give them 5 stars is that their phlebotomist had a very difficult time drawing my blood, which is unusual. I'm not sure he was that experienced, and as a result I was left with bruises and two sore arms. But really that's a minor thing overall. Several of my co-workers recommended One Medical, and they're right -- after the first visit here I was completely glad I'd paid the annual fee, if only not to have to endure another noisy, unfriendly, pack-em-in doctor's office where I only saw PAs and LPNs, never an actual doctor. That's been the opposite of my overall terrific experience at One Medical.",4,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Hasan Lee,"I cannot say enough good things about this office. Â I've lived in the city for 4 years, going from dr to dr trying to find someone that I clicked with. Â After settling for a horrible clinic on Davis St. that smelled of cigarette smoke (in a dr's office?) and urine where the dr. yelled at me for not remembering the dosage for my previous migrain perscription, I was MORE than happy to find a medical establishment that could 1) see me the same day I called (I like to get over my sickness as soon as possible) and 2) treated me with...what?... RESPECT.I found this office through all the great feedback from Yelp. Â After dealing for years with terrible dr's, I felt I deserved the best (weird that we settle for anything less when it comes to our livelihood)).I saw a PA, Angela Powlen, for some random pain near my liver. Â She sat there and listened to me and actually made EYE CONTACT with me (instead of staring at the chart their writing on). Â She wanted me to get an ultra sound and when I couldn't get an appt with the radiologist through reception, she called my office desk to tell me to go to the hospital. Â After spending an afternoon in ER, I came home to find, not 1, not 2, but 3 messages on my cell phone from her, calling to see how I wasw doing. Â She called the next day as well. Â I don't think there has EVER been a time where a dr followed up on me!!I've seen a number of different dr's at this office and every single one of them have been amazing. Â The rooms that you go into aren't stark cold, scary and intimidating. Â They are warm, comforting and inviting...and get this, the DR actually comes out to the waiting room to pick you up. Â And they TALK to you. Â Like, I mean, they listen and they ask really good questions and they tell you what their thinking so, together, you can work it out to figure what is truly the source of the illness.All of these dr's are amazing, this establishment it where all medical offices SHOULD be heading towards.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Leland Michael,"After arriving from a country with a very different medical system, it took me months to find a GP through my insurance. Every time I thought I had found one in the neighborhood that I wanted, it would turn out that they no longer existed or were actually dermatologists. Finally, I happened upon One Medical Group (Metropolitan at the time). I was so thankful just to find regular doctors who could help me with all my complaints or refer me to specialists. I'm not that bothered about which doctor I see as I believe them all to be competent but I always get to see one of two doctors anyway. I am happy to pay the annual fee if it means I have a doctor on hand as and when I need one. The medical and insurance world are scary places in this country so $100ish a year seems a small price to pay (as someone who can afford it, I know for others it may not seem small) for a little piece of mind. The only reason I have knocked off a star is that I have had a couple of insurance gaffs with them.

I once went in about a back problem so sever I could not sit down when I saw the doctor, they messed up the physical therapy referral so badly and over and over again until I had waited two weeks for a referral. Just a few weeks ago I saw a NP at the California office and she was on her iPhone the entire conversation, she did not even try to hide it. The doctors and NP's are unprofessional and unhelpful!

Katerina Poole,"Having grown cynical about the healthcare profession in general after years of missed diagnoses, lack of compassion, hyper-specialization and antiquated administrative processes, I was thrilled to find One Medical Group.Dr. Milo challenged me to lower my cholesterol and gave me a diet and exercise plan that brought my level down 56 points. Â When I scratched my cornea, they had the equipment and expertise to diagnose and deal with the problem on the spot. Â They don't send you to a random clinic to get a blood test - it's all done on-site. Â I can send health-related questions to Dr. Milo by e-mail and he responds the same day. Â They're open-minded about alternative, holistic solutions to medical problems.In short, One Medical Group has changed my attitude toward the medical profession and made me a healthier person in the process.

Jorden Chamberlain,"This is my second review of OneMedical. I wish I could have a single positive thing to say about them! The first review I wrote in March was about how they did not have a doctor see me during my well care visit, instead had a trainee attend me. Things got worse since then. Here is how.. I filed a complaint in their office about that visit and they asked me to go for a second time. They said they will waive the second visit. When I went, this time a real doctor saw me. She said the well care lab work done earlier (given by the trainee and done at OneMedical facility in San Francisco) was incomplete as some of the routine tests were not done. So she gave a second round of lab work and I went to the same lab facility within oneMedical office. The nurse wasnt able to find a blood vessel with 3 pokes so she asked me to come back another day. Apparently a nurse is not allowed to poke more than 3 times at one go. So I went back a third day and got the blood work done. Now OneMedical has sent me a bill saying the lab work was done out of network and I have to pay the out of network charges. So, OneMedical who is in network for me has a lab within their office where I went first time and was covered as in network. But the second time it became out of network! If they had changed lab partners, they did not notify me and I am getting dinged for that! Â I have already lost 1 work day because of a severe allergic reaction to a shot given to me by the trainee during my first visit. I lost another half day of work in total for all the 3 times I went there and now I have to pay out of network charges!! This is beyond ridiculous! This is criminal!",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Yvette Deleon,"Very satisfactory! Â The office is very clean, the staff is friendly and the doctor made me feel as comfortable as possible in a very uncomfortable situation. Â She took a lot consideration into how to deal with my problem, and presented me with all the options, not criticizing the one I chose.Although there is a $99 annual fee, it's totally worth it in a day and age where it's so hard to find a good doctor.

Cassius Mccormick,"Horrble experience.I booked a Saturday appointment at the Pac Heights clinic in February, with dizziness, presumably from a cold, and breast tenderness. Â The ""doctor"", a man who's profile I have yet to see on their website, diagnosed with clogged ears (no big deal), but then refused to do a breast exam where I experienced the soreness, mumbling something about it being Saturday and he's ""chilling out"", having worked at a homeless clinic in SF during the week. He also couldn't clean my ears because he didn't have the appropriate equipment. SO, I left the office halfway diagnosed but pretty much untreated. Unhappy with the care I received and looking for relief, I then spent $100 on a professional ear cleaning from an ear specialist (they actually have tools to do this that doesn't involve spraying your ear with water.. why didn't the doctor tell me that?)AND went to California Pacific, where a GYNECOLOGIST was able to do a breast exam for me - also questioning the practices of a doctor who out-sources a breast exam- finding nothing (thank God) but urging me to have my breasts checked whenever I feel necessary (I am 34).AND I get charged $291 for my office visit, through my insurance plan. That's $150 to join a medical practice where I can be treated by a doctor who must out-source me to another more qualified doctor + $291 for the One Medical physician visit + $100 for the ear doctor (which I found on my own) + co-payments and CPMC Gynecologist fees (only $59 through my insurance). Can someone explain to me what the value is here?I was hoping One Medical would truly stand as exemplary in San Francisco. I am unimpressed. People see the doctor when they are sick. Not to 'hang out' in a high-design space and ""chill"" with their care providers. Unprofessional and poorly managed.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Elias Le,"Dr. Dinenberg, if you can get him, is the only doctor worth visiting One Medical for, and I've seen all of them. Â Charming, funny, smart as hell, and he remembers you.Everyone is nice, and the office is super clean, but I feel the knowledge is very lacking. Â I've had three separate incidents where doctors screwed up the treatments:-One doctor didn't know how to use a liquid nitrogen gun to remove a wart, and I spent a half hour while he kept refilling it wrong, and then when he was done, he said the wart would come off on its own. Â But it never did. Â -One doctor jammed a q-tip inside my penis during a routine STD test, and caused a tear in my urethra. Â -One doctor tried to remove a SCALP STAPLE with an office staple remover. Â I ended up needing to go to the hospital over that one...thanks.They don't keep track of what you're doing. Â You go back for a followup, it's with a different doctor, and they haven't reviewed the file. Â There doesn't appear to even be a file to speak of, because they are 'paperless'. Â You end up explaining the whole story again, instead of the doctor reviewing the file electronically.You pay $150 for the 'luxury' of same day appointments, doctor email, and Rx fax without an appt. Â But you don't really receive that. Â Doctors take sometimes 2 days to get back to you, and sometimes I've not received any response to my emails. Â Guess what? Â Many doctors have email now, take same day appointments, and can fax the Rx for you without a doctor visit...and no boutique fees. Â Do the homework, and find a better doctor that won't rip you off. Â My guess is that people comfort themselves paying extra, so that they feel they won't have to share the office with people who can't afford that, as in, poor or undesirable people. Â I think that's what's being catered to by groups like this.Oh, and another purported reason for the membership fee: Â you can be seen on a Saturday. Â But I actually needed that once, and I was told that the visit would not be insured, and I would have to pay out of pocket, even though I have PPO coverage. Â They couldn't explain why. Â They said it's a different system on the weekends, is all.Another story, I needed a chest x-ray, and One Medical produced an order for it to be filled at UCSF...where Brown &amp; Toland (the group that is contracted by One Medical) no longer have a contract. Â So, UCSF told me that they could do the x-ray, but it wouldn't be insured. Â I got on the phone with One Medical, and they couldn't figure out why UCSF would say that. Â They never once informed me that the HMO level of care would be rejected, but my PPO level of care is still good for UCSF. Â I have both PPO and HMO coverage through HealthNet (confusing, right, and no not One Medical's fault). Â But your doctor should be able to look at your coverage, and figure out the issue, and tell you what to do, and also the office staff should be skilled at that too. Â To boot, One Medical also is contracted by another medical group, Hill Group, who DOES have a contract with UCSF. Â I'm sorry, but for the extra $150, I would expect that somebody there could've explained the nuances of their business, and how they bill insurance and the many outsourcing schemes...and let me know that I had other options than going to another hospital for the x-ray.Then if there's a billing issue, you get to deal with Apollo Medical Group in Novato...who never knows what's going on. Â Somehow One Medical told Apollo that my birthdate was 8 years prior to my actual date, and it caused a denial of coverage by HealthNet...which took months to figure out the issue on, and clear up.And if you don't pay the $150 membership fee, you don't get care. Â That's a denial of medical care. Â Isn't that illegal?So let me get this straight, they charge this money, deny care, can't do their own billing, and can't hire people who know the insurance system, or even their own business? Â Where is this money going? Â Rent?So, after 4 years of trying my best with this group, I have to leave. Â I tried to pick another medical group other than Brown &amp; Toland, but as I mentioned, Hill Group ALSO contracts to One Medical. Â I must dig deeper.If and when we ever get a universal or near universal care, where everyone gets equal care, less hassle, higher taxes, and fewer corporations with their hands in the cookie jar, it will be near utopian. Â Until then, it pays to find a simpler solution. Â And apparently it doesn't pay $150.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Tye Wardle,"I was assigned to a doctor at one medical group as my primary care physician through my HMO. Â Turns out, the doctor is not taking any new patients so I had to see a different doctor a part of the medical group.Initially calling the office to schedule my first appointment, the women on the phone explained to me that there is an annual $150 membership fee. Â I thought this was outrageous but after telling me that she understands I have health insurance and I can opt out of paying for the fee based on a waiver form online. Which I went ahead and filled out right away.On my first appointment, I checked in with the receptionist. Â The first words to come out of her mouth was ""It looks like you are due to pay our $150 annual membership"" Â And I explained to her that it was my first appointment, which she totally disregarded. Â I also told her about the waiver form which she also acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Â then I showed her my email ""Your waiver request has been processed. Should your situation change and you opt to pay our membership fee, simply go to your account at onemedical.md/pt/otp/bilâ¦ and enter your payment information."" Â After seeing that she says, well it's being processed and not necessarily approved. Â Then I was called into my doctors visit. Â I did not feel like doctor I saw paid any special attention to me at all. Â Leaving, she also forgot to prescribe me medication I asked for during the visit. Â I also explained to her about areas that had discomfort. Â Instead of actually looking at the area, she just ordered more labs. Â Yes, she got the most important thing that I needed to visit the doctor for done, but a thorough doctor and so they say they have ""fresh new approach"" that I also did not experience.After my doctors appointment, and checking out with the front desk. Â I spent another 5 minutes talking to the front desk again about the $150. Â She kept tryng to explain that the $150 helps maintain their facility and provide me with services that other offices do not, for ex, same day appointments, emails, online appointments, and online prescription renewals. Â And she said to me, just because I have health insurance does not mean I don't have to pay for it. Â Well, why would I have health insurance then??? And also, my last doctor who was amazing and I can no longer see, also, emailed me, provided me with same day appointments, and called the pharmacy for me to renew my prescription. I feel as though they should not state its an ""optional"" membership fee, because clearly it is not. Â In the end, the receptionist unhappily waived my fee but said, at any moment you can pay for it please do. Â And we will be asking you for the membership fee in one year.I felt forced to pay a membership fee I didn't feel like I needed to pay. Â I also feel as though I was not provided with the care that everyone else describes. Â Perhaps I need to visit a different doctor here. Overall, a stressful experience, and oh, that extra 5 min made me 5 min over the 1 hr parking, which bumped me up to $6 for parking at the sutter parking lot.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Ocean Woodard,"Update: a very helpful person from the back office called me after my insurance company contacted them and demanded immediate reimbursement for me. She refunded me the visit fee, which was due to me. She also refunded me the annual membership charge and offered to keep my membership open should I want to come back for another visit. I really do appreciate this effort on their part, but they should get their billing system under control. Hopefully I will return to the office for a great visit. I will post an update when I do.I joined One Medical late last year because I loved the idea of making appointments online and the convenience of multiple locations. I paid the membership fee of $149 and the fee for my initial visit, $150, which I found reasonable. They also did me the curtesy of billing my insurance. Now it appears that my insurance also paid them $172 for the visit. I just happened to notice this when reviewing my EOBs. I called the office to inquire if this an overpayment. The person who answered the phone said he would look into my inquiry, and contact the billing department and get back to me. Six days later, I call back to ask what is going on. The receptionist checks with the person who handled my original call and says that ""he is on top of it"" and that he hasn't heard from the billing department, but as soon as he does, he will call me back. I ask when I can expect a call back. She tells me that refunds can take up to two to three weeks. I say, ""yes, I understand this, but when will he call me back to tell me how this has been resolved?"" She says that it could take a couple of days, she's not really sure. I interrupt her to tell her that I want a date, so that if I don't hear back from him, I will call them again. I suggest a couple of days, and she picks the furthest one out. At the end of the conversation, she makes a grunt of some kind and hangs up the phone, without thanking me or saying goodbye. This kind of treatment, although quite insignificant in the grand scheme of things, just put me in a bad mood. I suppose I will call Blue Shield and work from that angle, as they are always very helpful. Oh, and while I'm bitching, the doctor I saw knew nothing about acupuncture. I had just assumed that the doctors would at least know when it was appropriate to refer a patient to an acupuncturist.

Teddy Moyer,"First impression is the most important... I set up an appointment one week in advance with Dr.Wu. at 3:30PM.

The front desk forgot to check me in the computer. The dumb person claimed that there was a bug in the computer and wanted me to take another day off to see the doctor(I came from East bay). The manager claimed that the front desk forgot to checked me in because she was confused that I was not registered, so...So... The bug was in fact a problem between the keyboard and the chair..not the computer.. Dr. Wu refused to see me after the other patient...Claiming that the next appointment would be too late...Think she's going to try to make it up? No.. Just take another appointment!!! I guess that's fair to think that a patient.. that's just a piece of meat that will be ready to take a day off and pay for a pricey parking in SF to see her Majesty the Doctor...So.. Dealing with a bunch amateurs... No thank you. I'm stuck with this bunch of morxns for at least a month before I can switch.Oh BTW.. You pay a fee and think that you can see any doctor right away?

What's the point in paying an extra $150/yr on top my copay if they can't accommodate same day appointments for folks with busy schedules . . . . especially when the first bullet point on their website is: - Same-day appointments to fit your busy scheduleRather, maybe it should read:- Same-day appointments to fit OUR busy schedule",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sana Mcbride,"I am losing all patience with One Medical. Â My husband and I are their exact demographic - young professionals who are relatively healthy and just looking for convenience. Â But One Medical has gone utterly downhill of late, so much so that I plan on cancelling my membership after I finish my current slate of vaccinations. Â All we wanted to do was get our immunizations done - my husband so he can get complete his green card application - and me in anticipation of potentially changing employers/insurers and thinking ahead to the possibility of getting pregnant. Â Call after call, they just can't get it done. Â My husband is on the phone with Jennifer right now and she is telling him that he has to get a blood draw first, which makes no sense at all, since he needs a documented MMR so the civil surgeon can sign off on his I-693. Â I've been going back and forth with them on the vaccinations that I need, and they keep insisting that I've probably had immunizations as a child that I know that I haven't.

Online appointment scheduling is very convenient. I love having access to naturopaths and acupuncturists alongside my regular physician.

Sienna-Rose Sheridan,"First, they told me that the $99 would be covered by my flex spending so at least it would really only be like $65 in real dollars in my life. Â Not the case. Flex dollars will not pay this.Second, they told me they were worth it because I would never have to wait. I figure ok, fine. I have a certain number of hours I have to bill. They translate into a certain number of dollars to me, so it is going to save me time, which = $, to not have to wait. And then I get there and I wait. Over ten minutes. Usually I would not in the least mind waiting ten minutes. But when you just persuaded me to pay you $100 because I wouldnt have to wait, don't make me wait. Really. At least THIS time since you promised me that YESTERDAY.Later in the year. Their docs are useless. I find a specialist on my own. He is amazing and saving my life, renewing my will to live. I ask them to at least try referring me to him. Â You know, in case my stupid insurance would cover it. They wouldn't even try. Now, I bet it would not have mattered. But, really, I just paid you $100 for the pleasure of your services and you couldn't do what I needed and now you won't even refer me to this impressively credentialed MD at USF? Thanks. Thanks. So, one day, I asked the doctor why she became a DO instead of an MD. She basically said because it was easier to get in to school. No passion for alternative health care. No belief that maybe drugs arent the best answer. Just easier to get that degree. Great!So then as my year of disappointment comes to an end they send me a message about renewing my membership- this time for $149. I write back and say, in sum, hell no, don't you dare charge my cc. They charge my cc. I work it out, but the time it takes certainly eats away at any claim that they could make that they offer such efficient service.So, if you've got $100 sitting around to blow on the same old piss poor healthcare you get anywhere, go for it. At least you don't have to leave the building.Addendum: as *soon* as I posted this, I was contacted by the owner wanting to make things better. That would have been nice 6 months ago when I was trying to deal with the crap service. I am glad Yelp provides a forum for our voices to be heard outside of whatever feedback channels a business provides us. But, I have read the reviews on here and I think he does this all the time. That is nice and all. But then people change their reviews. So, their overall score looks decent. But if you are considering using their services, you aren't getting an honest assessment of what you are going to encounter. What you are getting is an assessment of what you will get if you bitch and moan on Yelp. No thanks. I was wiling to pay for what you told me I would get.

Alastair Jones,"I have been going here for a few months now and can really notice the difference. I enjoy that I see the doctor without having to wait for nurses and the doctor is with me from the time I start the visit until I leave. I really appreciate that. I can't even tell you how much I hate waiting for a nurse, talking to a nurse, talking to a dr, then the dr leaves and I don't know what happened. Â I really think it's worth the extra money per year.That being said....DO NOT ALLOW JENNIE COSSMAN TO EVEN SPEAK TO YOU. She won't pay attention to what you are telling her your symptoms are and will simply tell you how you feel. I went in crying because I was so upset about not feeling good that instead of even looking at me, she tells me I need a shrink. I tell her that is not my problem and she tells me I don't know what I feel. She even started yelling at me to tell me how depressed she thought I was. In the end, I was having a weird reaction to my birth control. I stopped taking it and the problem went away. Of course I wasn't depressed and I knew that.

Renesmae Vance,"3.5 stars. Pros: Convenient to make appointments as it's easy to reach a real person (previously I went to Kaiser, which I reviewed). Another convenient feature: Being able to email your doctor is genius. I always procrastinate going to the doctor's office, and now with email access, perhaps one seldom has to go.  I really like my doctor -- she's kind and helpful and communicative. Even though my questions are sometimes more suitable for specialists, she's been great at giving me a second opinion. She's very good at noticing unexpected things: giving me a useful sheet for iron deficiency healthcastle.com/iron.shâ¦ and proactively testing me for ferritin and vitamin D. Plus she's so personable and nice that it makes the whole experience of having to go to the doctor's office very pleasant. Cons: Lack of preventing testing. Regular blood tests that I get at Kaiser, e.g. for cholesterol and blood sugar, are hard to get here. I had to argue to get these tests this year, and I don't know whether I can successfully get them next time. (My blood sugar is greater than 90 and LDL is greater than 95, which are not exactly low.) I'm happy to pay for these tests if my insurance doesn't, but it does, and that doesn't seem to be the issue. Judging from other reviews of people with similar complaints of their doctors not approving cholesterol tests, this is endemic to One Medical. Perhaps One Medical has lower standards for cholesterol? (My doctor said my LDL is excellent... My friend's cholesterol is 215, he has high blood pressure, and his doctor at One Medical is not worried.) This makes Kaiser look good in comparison -- Kaiser is very good at preventive care (took an excellent back care class there).Still it is convenient and I really like my doctor -- hopefully I'll remain healthy and don't need tests so I'm staying for now.Update 07.12.2010: Dr. Thomas Lee, the owner of One Medical Group, contacted me and said that getting preventive testing is not a problem. I appreciate his message and hopefully upon future visits can push the rating up to where it should be: 5 stars.",3,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Patrik Molloy,"First of all - GO HERE. Â These guys are great, they really, really care about you, and most of all, especially for busy, young professionals, they get it. Â The coolest doctors I've ever had. Â These guys would get a five, except that in the last year they increased their annual fee 50% (to $150), but at the same time, have not been able to give me a same day appointment (which is their big selling point) the last 3 times I tried. Â THAT SAID, when I complained about this they immediately responded with a personal e-mail and even offered to let me come in that day if I still needed care!!! Â AWESOME. Â Also, they are expanding and adding another office and more doctors, so they can hopefully reach equilibrium soon. Â I think part of the problem is that they have become so popular, so quickly it's just a supply and demand issue...and supply is supposedly on the rise.You can usually get an appointment within the next day or two (even if it is with an R.N. -- though their RNs are pretty darn good). Â And their appointments are LONG! Â So awesome. Â I have never ever felt rushed out of there. Â The full doctors are ridiculously smart and attentive. Â Dr. Miko is super cool, too. Â My only gripe with him is that he sent me to Financial District Foot and Ankle which is a total money-making racket that has the worst customer service ever.Also, the same day appointment thing really only works if you are flexible, too (i.e. don't demand a same day appointment if your foot hurts; save it for the flu and other acute pain and symptoms, so you don't squeeze others out). Â For instance, I had knee issues during the Swine Flu epidemic...I was okay with having to wait 2 days for an appointment.But all-in-all one of the nicest group of folks, very modern, very worth the $100 (damn...now $150 a year).",4,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

If you any remotely complicated issue - from a persistent cold to a concussion to a gynecological appt - it is terrible. For one, you wait just as long to see as a doctor than at any other practice - sometimes longer because OneMedical doesn't have many MDs relative to patients. Even worse, they will always push you to see an RN even when the issue is more complicated and the doctor knows more. And their care model means you don't talk to one provider consistently. I would write them about issues and get an email back from a different nurse every time. I would have to re-explain everything to them each time, and would get different advice. They only gave a cursory look at my chart.

Â It feels like a team effort.6. Email. Â You can have meaningful dialogue and follow-up with your doctor via email. Â They take the time to summarize things. Â They are extremely responsive.

Paris Witt,"Yes, there is the annual fee, which I hate paying when I am poor and also paying for an individual private plan... but with the state of the health care system in this country, I would rather be safe (and slightly poorer) than sorry (/bankrupt). The same-day appts are great, as is the email access. And I've felt like I was in good hands with the various physicians I have visited here. If they take your insurance plan and you are willing to pay the annual fee, definitely check this place out, much better than dealing with the bureaucrats.",5,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Nelly Hills,Best medical practice I have ever been too. Â The entire staff is professional yet friendly. Â Have never had to wait more than 5 minutes past appointment time.

Avi Wynn,"I am so very thankful for One Medical Group! Â I have been sick for almost 3 weeks and my doctor decided to drop my insurance apparently as of Aug 1 (unbeknownst to me - yeah, would have been nice to have gotten a letter about that...) so when I had to get in to a doctor quickly - One Medical Group was there. Â And not only did I get a same day appointment, for the first time in my adult life I got true kindness when I went to see a medical doctor. Â I was heard, I wasn't kept waiting for 20 minutes to be seen, and today - she followed up with me to see how I was doing! Â Yes, it costs $149.00 a year to join, but this is such a nominal price for what you get including but not limited to the convenience of same day appointments, the many different locations they have available and the empathetic care you receive. Â Being treated like a human being, customer service, wow - I never thought I was the cynical type but I almost can't believe this place is for real.

Jett Pierce,"2 stars only because I've had good experiences with Carrie Bowler and Angela Powlen at the Sutter St. location in the past. They seemed genuinely caring and competent. The rest of the experiences I've had there would receive 0 stars if I could.I've been with One Medical Group since it was Metropolitan Medical Group (3-4 years). I used to be really impressed with their service (Angela, Carrie), but it has become way too evident that the group has shifted their focus from same-day quality patient care to becoming a cash-generating operation looking out for the insurance companies' best interests. I am dropping them and filing a formal complaint.Without getting into a long description of all the ways they've jeopardized my health for their own financial gain in the past year, I'll just say that I've had several doctors in private practice tell me that this place can't be trusted for anything more than prescription refills and rash diagnoses...and I wouldn't even recommend them for the latter. I went in with what turned out to be just an allergic skin reaction to the metal rivets in my jean pockets (think of where your back pockets are) and had the nurse tell me I had herpes!!...I won't share my other two stories (the real reason I will never go back) since they're even more personal than that one, but when I went for second opinions in the other two instances, the new doctors I saw were appalled at what I had been told by the doctors at One Medical Group. One muttered ""One Medical Group"" while shaking her head and told me she knew they were just trying to make money off more appointments and that I had been flat-out lied to (her words). Another doctor said One Medical Group was more concerned about the insurance system and told me to get them to sign a form taking responsibility for my health outcome if they still wouldn't prescribe the necessary MRI they denied me. Anyway, if you feel like paying $150/yr to have a doctor do something they would already do for no extra charge (fill prescriptions and answer questions), then sign up with One Medical Group. If you need a real diagnosis that isn't dependent on whether or not they can bill it easily, or if it will hurt Â their standing with an insurance company, then come on Yelp and find a doctor who gives a s#!t.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Miller Bean,"Been a ""privileged"" member for 3+ years. Â I am always blown away by the ""Doogie Howser"" element of Dr's there.

Georgie Campbell,"My one-star review was not an easy decision to make: It was a very easy decision to make.My caveat is that this review is not reflective of the quality of care provided by Metropolitan Medical Group; this review reflects my overall experience and the way in which the group is administered.That said, on to the review:First, let it be known that one star is for the ease of which you can get an appointment. You can call and more than likely someone will see you today. Wonderful! The downfall: I have been three times and have yet to see the same person. Of course, the above is dependent on being able to get through the phone lines. (I got the impression from the site that I would be able to schedule appointments electronically. Signing into my account affords no such options--at least that I can find.) While staff members are nice (plus one star), the group appears to be grossly understaffed (minus one star). The floor plan for the Sutter office (the remodeled one even) requires you to either wait in line right by the elevator or to take a seat and then try to sort of out who is next as there is only one person to take calls and admit people. I had a question about billing and was directed to someone outside the office. I left a message, but felt uncomfortable giving too much of my information as the answering machine to this random number appeared to be something run out of someone's home. While I am not concerned about the billing department's competency (OK, I'm a little concerned; I've been through three times and have yet to see any sort of bill or be asked for a copayment), it just all felt a little less than professional--or at least outside of my usual medical group experience.Last--but definitely not least as this one is the worst offender--is the lab. You will be asked to go off-site to go to the lab. OK, so this is not ideal. I'm used to being in the same building for both my clinician and lab services, but fine, I'm healthy and able-bodied (what do people who aren't do?) so I can walk the four blocks. But then you get to the lab and it's this strange set up where if no one is at the desk, it's not quite clear what you are supposed to do outside of writing your full name on a pad (which in itself seems odd as far as confidentiality--again maybe this is strange because I'm used to writing down, say, just my last name). In fact, I'm not sure privacy is a huge concern for them as any sort of urine test requires you to WALK DOWN THE HALL to use the building's floor bathroom. The walk to the bathroom, while strange, is not so bad as the walk back to the lab, during which time you have a huge sharps receptacle in one-hand (it's their keychain) and YOUR URINE in the other as you walk past the elevator bank and some other businesses and their patrons. OK, maybe the most offensive part isn't parading around with my own urine. Maybe it's the $75 you pay for the above privileges. I did it out of desperation (needed to have a prescription filled after changing plans and after two hours of calling I still couldn't find another group accepting new patients). Yeah, the $75 may be the worst part.",1,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Sam Dickson,"Not really following through with their promises of same day appointments. Â More like ten days out; a significantly longer delay than what I was accustomed to with my previous primary care practice; for which, by the way, I didn't have to pay $149/year.

Rebekah Heaton,"BEST medical care I have ever received. Established my PCP (Dr. Kim) here a few weeks ago and can't stop raving about my experiences thus far. Firstly, you can fill out all of your medical history online before heading to the office. The staff is friendly and helpful. Very progressive doctors. My new doc is helping me take a supplemental approach to my health and has also suggested alternative remedies for the ailments one would normally ""pop a pill"" for. After my first visit I received a personal e-mail from my doctor outlining EVERYthing we discussed including some helpful attachments with info on general healthy eating habits for my age, stress relief tips and tricks (breathing exercises), etc. The best part is...same day appointments! And I love the ability to e-mail the doctor with any questions you might have. I've already had a question and received a reply directly from my doctor within 48 hours! AMAZING.

Kasey Lindsey,"I used to have a great Doctor who seemed to know everything about everything.

Â I also feel like a lot of the Doctors there seem a little phony, they seem like they are looking all answers for everything online.

Â  After going here for about 2 years I think I'm going to start looking for someone who has they're own small practise who actually seems to care I'm really starting to feel like it's the Walmart/McDonalds of healthcare and i'm tired of being treated like I'm a 5 year old child everytime I go in. Â In addition to them not being able to even start me with samples of an antibiotic as I was too broke I was told to simply go to the ER if I feel worse cause they will just bill me later since I have no money now",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Rudra Quintana,"I joined here almost 1 year ago and am really impressed. Â The concept is awesome and is much better than traditional doctor offices. Â The fee is very reasonable and really simplifies things if you have a PPO plan like me. Â Instead of browsing through countless lists of doctors, I go to one centralized place (similar to an HMO facility) and get all the treatment I need. Â If you need something they cannot offer in-house, they will give you several quality referrals. Â They also offer holistic services that you wouldn't normally receive at a regular facility. Â The office is nice and the staff are very courteous and professional. Â The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that it may take longer to get an appointment with someone you want to see then what their website promises (but not by much). Â All in all, I love this model of doing business and I think they do it quite well. Â Make the switch now!",4,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Falak Mora,"I was referred to the Metropolitan Medical group by a coworker and I like it. I have gone twice and they were able to get me in with the same PA. I scheduled the first one a week ahead and the other same day. Filling out the on-line form helped speed things along for my annual Physical and Pap exam. One drawback is that the lab is located at a different facility (450 Sutter), but my test results came back pretty fast. I happened to be in my PA's office 2 days after my visit to the lab for a followup appt and she was able to give me my results and then emailed them to me. I have been able to communicate via email with my PA and she is very good about following with me.

Devin Bennett,"They have become too big and the service is rushed. I never see an actual doctor, so you never really build a relationship with anyone.

They refused to refill unless I came in and they wanted me to see any doctor, this was just so they could profit. I know several co-workers that have left as well. About the membership fee, my insurance company told me it is illegal in the state of California to do this and in all fairness One Medical will waive it if you ask if you cannot afford. Â I know a friend she was on Methadone for PAIN not for Heroin addiction and they treated her like a junkie and she left after being a patient/member for over 7 years and they are the ones that sent/referrred her to the pain specialist that put her on the Methadone!

Darin Everett,"I've been with One Medical Group for almost a year now. I don't have much to praise them about but I don't have any strong negative compliant. However for $150/year, the receptions are friendly, helpful, and you'll be able to get same day appointment, but the quality of care is comparable to any other services or doctors. Overall it's not worth the $150/year.The travel clinic is a complete waste of time. I went to Peru in the summer and worked with the nurse, Julie West, to determine which shots I needed. Â Firstly, the travel clinic is on a different billing system so they will not work with the insurance company but will require you to pay upfront and for you to sort it out with the insurance company. Â The nurse basically read what shots was needed for Peru on the CDC website and insisted that I get ALL the recommended shots. Â She improperly advise that I needed certain shots and rather than telling me in advance, she told me when I went in to the office for the shots (waste of time). Â Fortunately they didn't charge me for the co-pay. Â  Since some of the vaccines were not available at One Medical Group, I had to go to a different clinic and choose the travel clinic @ CPMC. Â The travel nurse was AMAZING, she knew exactly which shots were required in different areas of Peru (which was important as I didn't need ALL the shots for Peru) and was able to speak intelligently about the different vaccines. She was very practical in her advice and CPMC worked directly with my insurance company regarding billings, which was much appreciated as apparently, insurance companies are very picky about which travel vaccines are covered and sometimes, they way it is administer, determines whether or not it is covered. Â The physician I selected is Dr. Maricar Pacquing, DO. Â Similar to other review, she has absolutely no personality and does not offer much in terms of over and above care. You ask her a question, she'll answer, and then you ask her your next question, and she'll answer. Â Again, no praise but can't complain since she didn't do anything wrong. Â The service just isn't worth paying a fee each year.Since Dr. Maricar Pacquing is on mat leave, I recently saw Aliciea Wu. Â Since she was not able to assist me with my question and wasn't really offering any service that was worth paying an additional fee for, I just went ahead and asked that they waive my co-pay, which they did.If you see a doctor frequently or considered yourself high-maintenance, this place and the membership fee would be worthwhile. Â  Â I have decided to take the extra effort to research various groups/doctors that would provide better quality care which is more important to me than being able to schedule a same day appointment. Â I'm still in the middle of my research but have already found a knowledge doctor that has made my visits much more worthwhile than Dr. Pacquing &amp; Dr. Wu.

Â She tried Metropolitan and they took her in that day without requiring her pay the annual fee before hand. Â Her experience was phenomenal.

Jaydan Denton,"My real review is 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow that, so I'm going with 3.The pluses: the doctors themselves are pretty good; the offices are downtown (a big plus for someone who struggles to find an open window of free time for an appointment); they usually run on time (again, a great thing for those of us whose days are packed); having email access (during business hours) to the doctors/care team is convenient; and having a general practitioner can be a positive thing (haven't had one of those since I was a kid--usually have just relied on my OB-GYN). Unfortunately, there have been some problems which justify a star deduction. Â I had to wait for several weeks to get an OB-GYN appointment for follow up testing. Â Then, the doctor's assistant cancelled the appointment at 6 p.m. the day before the appointment (after the phones had already been turned off for the day so that when I called back 2 minutes later no one answered). Â The reason? Â They apparently accidentally scheduled my appointment for a day the doctor had jury duty (something which they presumably knew about months ago but had not told me when I was scheduling the appointment). Â At a different appointment, I had to speak up and demand specific tests which the doctor didn't think I needed given my age and general good health (alas, the test results proved otherwise). Â On a separate visit, I also had an assistant try to give me a vaccine that I had received on a prior visit (apparently my chart indicated that I needed the shot but my chart had not been updated to show that I had received the shot--good thing I was paying attention and spoke up in time to stop her). Â And, on one occasion, the front desk made me pay in full and then had me personally follow up with my insurance company for reimbursement, something none of my other doctor's offices have made me do (like I said, it is hard enough to find the time to make the appointments--I don't have time to follow up on paperwork).In the end, I think the general practice medical care is competent but for specialized care you'll need to go elsewhere. Â They also need to work some on the support side of the business in order for One Medical to live up to its promises of being an efficient medical group for busy professionals.",3,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"

Ashley Fleming,"My experience with this medical group has been pretty mixed. I appreciate the same-day appointment scheduling, which I've utilized many times, and a couple of the practitioners I've seen here have been very helpful. Â However, for the last seven months or so I've been struggling with chronic insomnia Â (sleeping 2-5 hours a night most nights of the week) for which, after several visits, I've never received any useful recommendations, effective treatment, or a referral to someone who might be better able to give me that help. The primary care physician to whom I've been assigned (after my last doctor left) does not ask many questions, listen to my observations or concerns, or appear to care about my condition. Every time I've brought it up, she has jumped to prescribing me sleeping pills, as if my own experience and the scientific evidence hasn't found sleeping pills ineffective. Â Last time I saw her, at my urging, she finally got off the sleeping pill band-aid and instead gave me the recommendation to try geting off caffeine for five weeks to see if my condition might improve. I suppose that's a reasonable next step but there was something about the recommendation -- maybe the fact that it came after months of what seemed like ""go away and leave me alone"" type care, or the fact that I consume very little caffeine anyways, or the fact that my insomnia has never, in my experience, been linked with caffeine consumption, which I told her, or the fact that insomnia can have literally thousands of different triggers-- just made me feel like I was being sent away with a shot-in-the-dark type solution to my suffering. If she'd suggested I keep a sleep log-- so I could simultaneously track the impact of many different factors on my sleep -- or if she'd indicated she'd like me to try a program of systematically cutting out different common culprits, starting with coffee -- or if she'd given me a referral to a sleep specialist-- I would have been much more satisfied with the recommendation. As it was, it felt really unlikely to lead to any improvements, which, as a matter of fact, it didn't. Â The other MD at One Medical I saw about this condition also put me on sleeping pills and in addition spent most of my session proselytizing about the health benefits of strict veganism --I was a vegatarian already at the time, which most experts agree is as healthy as or more healthy than strict veganism-- so it's hard to see how this was useful medical advice to me. Sorry, but I'm looking for care elsewhere.",2,One Medical,"Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Concierge Medicine"
Mackenzie Squires,"Do NOT send your family here. The hospital physicians in this hospital are terribly trained. St. Francis outsources their physicians to a corporate physician group, which is not unusual nor necessarily a problem except that their training and clinical reasoning are subpar at best. My family member died prematurely as a result of their repeated lapses in clinical judgment, failure to discharge the patient with appropriate guideline-directed therapies, unwillingness to consult specialists (standard practice in most General Hospital), and failure to listen to patient family's request even when family is medically trained. For instance, despite repeated re-admissions for heart failure, they refused to discharge with the next-level of guideline-directed therapies set forth by the American Heart Association. In the final admission, they finally listened and consulted a cardiology ""specialist"", who promptly (I am not kidding) decided against the heart failure drug due to the fact that the patient had heart failure. Read that again. For the sake of other patients, I truly hope this was a one-time lapse in judgement. They refused to consult their own radiologists to parse out the patient's pulmonary diagnosis. They refused indicated radiographic studies that would have significantly altered our understanding of the seriousness of the patient's condition as well as what treatments were necessary. From the beginning, the doctors were most interested in simply stabilizing the patient and rushing them home rather than spending the time to come up with an adequate treatment plan. Unfortunately, this speaks to the growing trend of medical corporatization and overwork of medical providers across the country. This should scare you - this entire hospital has ONE doctor for non-ICU patients overnight. Again, this is NOT unusual in the industry! However, there are definitely General Hospital nearby that are better than the average - St. Francis is just not one of them. Why does this hospital get 2 stars? Because there are some things that it does do well. They have an excellent rehab unit. They are the very best at treating burns. The gender institute is renown. The private practice surgeons (eg orthopedics) that do their surgeries at this hospital are overall very competent from what I hear. Outside of these reasons, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL.",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Francis O'Connor,"I chose to have my surgery here in Saint Francis Memorial back in September Â I really like all my nurses and the way they took care of me I think I had all female nurses. They were kind and caring and motherly to me and I never once felt neglected or scared to be there. One nurse that really made an impression for me and made the difference in how I felt while being there was a nurse by the name of Ernesto! Ernesto really made me feel as if I was staying at a private mansion with my own private nurse. He has such a kind and caring demeanor about him he is very gentle and compassionate. He put my insecurities at ease and took my shame of being there away. You are very vulnerable while being in a hospital and he made all the difference for me. He payed attention to me, treated me with that special care that lacks in General Hospital ( my entire family works in General Hospital and I have been in many top General Hospital ) . On discharge day he helped me get dressed and treated me as a friend, with respect and kindness! I will always remember Ernesto and he is the reason I am actually considering becoming a nurse myself! Any hospital that has the honor of having Ernesto to be present with their patients is truly a lucky place.

Clay Huff,Got a $1.9K bill for less than 10 minutes ER visit. Wow!!! I am so upset I had to share with everyone. Why I got two different bills? Not sure yet.

Jaeden O'Quinn,"Yeah I agree with other reviews. Something definitely changed with this hospital, I've been to the emergency room before in 2015, and 2016 and even admitted to the hospital and my copay was always 150$. It is one reason I didn't hesitate to go to the ER at Saint Francis, because I knew my insurance would cover everything. A month later I received the bill, it was around 5k for the ER, my insurance covered a big chunk but I still owe 1k and I was not even admitted to hospital. Definitely would not recommend ER here, they will overcharge you, some shady business practices is going on here and they should be investigated.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Teddie Mcguire,Hospital is very old. I felt as though I went back in time when I had an appointment for a simple ultrasound. 30 minutes to register at the registration desk another 20 minutes to wait to be seen for the appointment at the radiology appointment. I couldn't believe all the paperwork one department needed instead of looking in their system. You would be out of luck if you forgot your doctor referral. If your thinking of taking a hour and a half off work for an appointment forget it.

Hallam Duarte,"February 13, 2020 at 4:15pm.Â I am reporting on a male nurse who became physically violent on me. I waited for a full week for the hospital to respond to my ""Patient ComplaintÂ Form"" I left the hospital before I left that day. Not aÂ single word.Due to vomiting and diarrhea lasting over a week my provider had sent me to the hospital to get a couple of bag of fluids in me to help regain my strength and weaken immune system. I've been living with A.I.D.S. for over 30 years.Â I went into St. Francis Memorial Hospital here in San Francisco because it is my neighbor hoods hospital. They had me do a stool kit test. I used the only bathroom in the emergency department everyone else's who is being seen for being sick uses, which di not have any soap dispenser in the bathroom.Â My private thoughts, this is flu season in ER and U.S. Surgeon states hand washing is a must to fight coronavirus.Â I went back to my assigned bed and all of a sudden a male nurse rushes into the my bed area, he does not introduce himself, I have never seen before, he announces I'm out of here, right now! I look up at the bag of fluid and saw that it wasn't even half way gone and told that male nurse that I was to stay until the bag of fluids was fully gone, fully emptied. He said angrily, no you don't, you leave now. I asked him for his name he would not disclose it. He wore the NR badge. I asked to see my doctor because I had further questions about what to do after I leave the emergency room. He snarkily aggressively said, I am your doctor and you are leaving now! I never saw this person before.Â This male nurse then grabbed my arm without forewarning, without telling me he was going to be touching me before he touched me. I flinched my arm away from him he re-grabbed my arm and held tight. I told him politely to stop touching me. He would not stop, he became more aggressive and would not let go of my arm nor explain his actions. I kept telling him, ""Do not touch me."" ""Stop touching me."" ""Stop grabbing me."" ""Let go of my arm you are hurting me."" ""Stop TOUCHING MY BODY NOW!."" I was forced to go from polite tone to screaming due to his actions. He would not let go of his grip on my arm as I struggle to get my arm freed. He then grabs the IV in my arm and yanked it out. Blood squirted all over the place. He then announced you can now leave throwing my discharge papers onto the floor and stormed out. When I got into the lobby my arm was still bleeding.Â No one in the emergency department came to see what was the disturbance nor would they disclose this individual's name. I wanted him arrested.My partner of five years was in shock to see this happening as he witnessed this through a window of the lobby. The hospital would not let my partner be with me during this ER visit. Don't know why, perhaps homophobic or afraid of witnesses?Â In my 30+ years of dealing with HIV medical stuff I have never dealt with a rude bedside manners, not to mention their aggressive violently nature. This is the first time in all these years, decades I was treated with violence at a medical center. I went to a safe, non-violent place to seek out help and I left sicker due to this individual and his violent ways. I spent the night shaking and crying, until four in the morning after two sedatives. I am most likely not the only individual who had to face this male nurse's aggressive physical violence. I was taught when a nurse physically starts to harms you, you need to say stop immediately, this nurse did not.Â If you see violence REPORT IT! Stop of the violence!",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Blake Mack,The level of overcharging with St. Francis hospital billing may be legal but it feels like fraud. A recent stay for 1 day of non surgical treatment (observation and tests only) cost similar to the costs of a full operation in a typical hospitalThey overcharge for routine procedures and scans by 5x or 10x. The overcharging part is all on the part of the hospital - the doctors bills (which were submitted through a separate organization ) were reasonable.,1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Caelan Jimenez,I was there 8/31/2015- 9/27/2015(approximately) because my dads girlfriend called the police I pushed my dad. After I got 5150 my dad and his gf went to tokoyo.

I wasn't even 5150 material I was coming down off drugs and it put me in an entire cycle of medication addiction to anti psychotic drugs that ruined my life for almost FOUR YEARS. This place tried to tell me I'm schizophrenic when I'm not. AT ALL. I spent my 28 birthday there. I had so much going on in my life that they had students studying to become professionals interview me about ALLLLL sorts of stuff asking me questions about how my brain worked.

Jessie Maynard,"At the age of 65, I have either visited or been an admitted patient in more than 25 General Hospital. Without comparison, Saint Francis is THE noisiest hospital I have had to endure. As a patient with an extremely painful gallbladder attack, I had already been without sleep for 24 hours before being admitted to Saint Francis. In the following 18 hours after being given a bed, lasting until 4AM the next day, a nearby room's TV was blaring at its highest volume. Even after I painfully made my way to my room's door to close it, the TV could still be heard at half of its maximum volume. Then the night nurse came by and said I HAD TO keep my door open! After asking her WHY was there a TV noise allowed to blare throughout the floor, she said that a ""report"" had been lodged with the building maintenance staff to UNPLUG THAT DAMNED TV! When I said I WOULD GLADLY UNPLUG THE DAMNED TV MYSELF, she laughed at me. Within 15 minutes, I dressed myself and left the hospital against medical advice. The next day, I admitted myself to THE FAR SUPERIOR SUTTER HEALTH HOSPITAL ON NEARBY VAN NESS AVENUE. 12 hours after being admitted to Sutter Hospital, I underwent an operation to remove my EXTREMELY PAINFUL gallbladder. Saint Francis hospital ONLY PROLONGED MY SUFFERING! I guess the Hippocratic Oath has been completely disavowed by their entire staff of doctors and nurses!",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Jace Shaw,"All from 2015: I had a bad ER experience here where I was treated as if I was some kind of criminal for being in pain from a terrible ear infection that had gone on too long from being misdiagnosed. So for the crime of having a painful medical emergency, my boyfriend actually heard the nurses bad-mouthing me in the hallway for crying because I was in pain. A nurse came in and said they weren't going to do anything for me until I stopped crying. I simply had tears coming from my eyes from the pain, I wasn't involved in any kind of audible crying, but apparently it was NOT OK with them that saline was coming from my eyes.Felt like they were on a power trip, were angry with me for being in pain at an inconvenient time (midnight) even though I was one of three people waiting. I don't believe the reviews that talk about the nurses being alright. They seemed callous to me, uncaring of how or whom they traumatized or caused unnecessary intense physical pain. It felt like they had lost their sense of compassion and it had been replaced with cruelty.They ended up misdiagnosing me after ~2 minutes of actual medical attention (2nd misdiagnosis) &amp; giving me the wrong medicine (ended up making it worse + giving *more* pain). I had to pay around $250 out of pocket for this honor. I had to go to urgent care a few days later (also run by ""DIGNITY"" Health systems). There they MISDIAGNOSED ME AGAIN, prescribed $50 ear drops I didn't need, and a Dr. there says, ""ear infection is one of the most physically painful things an adult can experience,"" [yeah I noticed]. So shame on the nurses at St. F for shaming me for tearing up and making me stop before they would even look at me to treat me.So I was misdiagnosed (3rd! time), given MORE expensive wrong meds that HURT LIKE HELL to put in my ear. Finally got to an ENT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE CRAPPY ""DIGNITY"" System (how ironic a name is that?) after that weekend, and the ENT finally PROPERLY diagnosed me, gave me the right meds, and I got better...but not before I ended up missing TWO WEEKS of work and bursting an EAR DRUM! Took 3 months for it to fully heal and to get full hearing back. I had to do a whole long hearing test to make sure. Whole mess amounted to a grand total of around $500. I WILL NEVER GO TO THE ST. F ER AGAIN!1st Experience @St. F: Had surgery w/ OK outcome here (my great surgeon happened to operate here). Pre-op was fine (even if it did seem to lag for too long...2 hours? Really? Eventually a nurse came in and turned on the bed heat air blasty thing and I was thinking jeez I wish you'd done that 90 minutes ago so I didn't have to spend the last 90 minutes freezing my butt off -- but of course she didn't check or ask before then). From that I sensed a base-level of negligence but ignored it at the time. When I woke up from surgery I seriously had to pee but I couldn't get out of bed yet; it took about 5 minutes of polite but consistent calling out and asking before a nurse came, acting somewhat personally offended at having to bring me a bedpan. She was good about taking it away and not spilling any on me, so that was cool. I gave her all my best thank-yous.It felt like getting released took longer than needed, &amp; they weren't really careful about making sure I was ok + didn't fall, even though I'd just had knee surgery. I was so grateful my partner at the time was with me; he watched over my fall risk. I think the fact that he was a big, tall, white, male with a deep voice and made my requests/advocated for me definitely helped me get better and quicker care. I am sure I would have had a much different experience otherwise. The nurses responded to him instead of me. He helped me instead of them because he was there while they were mostly absent. He helped me dress and had to put my shoes and socks on for me. I'm guessing if he wasn't there I would have been wheeled out barefoot as we got little further attention from any of the nurses once I was dressed and just waiting for an escort to wheel me out. They gave me crutches but didn't show me how to use them properly (I had surgery a few years after this at Post Street Surgery Center and they did show me how to use the walker they gave me after surgery [couldn't use crutches anymore, arm damage] - it took 60 seconds and kept me from hurting myself -- never got that from St. F). I did get two bills post-surgery and it was exorbitant. Did a lot of research beforehand, double confirmed codes for the surgery. The first one was expected. The second bill was some time later and seemed to be the hospital's non-itemized tack-ons, but I was too ignorant then to know what they were doing, I just paid it.St. F. Â I don't think the F stands for Francis. I don't think the St. stands for saint either.

Jia Broughton,"Very disappointing and Really really bad service here. Â I went here it was 2 in the morning for the emergency, because i got really hurt stomach ache and I dont know where to go. So i decided to came to this hospital and expecting for the treatment. after the register process. They called me and asked me for what is going on. And they brought me to the room where i should wait for the doctor. after 40 minutes and the doctor had not come yet, i decided to exit the hospital and i told the nurse inside the hospital if i feel more comfortable to wait at my apartment. BUT, the nurse ditch me by saying ""are you still gonna wait for the doctor or leave?"" and i just left. After a couple days i received a bill mailed to me for $250 ""even i did not see the doctor face"" I decided to call the hospital in order to ask what do i need to pay or if i could get any convince for the bill. On the other hand after they pulled my data they told me my bill is actually $850 because i was using the facility to wait in the room as well as because it is an Emergency. I was shocked at the moment because I was only laying on the bed and was waiting. But in the conversation the person told me that the only way to pay is if i am paying right now by the phone i will get 30% discount or i can pay with payment plan. I do not have any payment plan And after all i just decided to pay the $600 after the discount.

Callan Rush,"I'm sure there are good parts of the hospital. I've been a patient for over 10 years and I can't emphasize enough how great the sports medicine clinic is, but the hospital service quality has degraded since Dignity took over.The world is full of companies that are able to coordinate billing systems but Dignity is not one of them. It is common practice for them to issue old balances on new statements after paying it off. Â The hospital staff and the dignity billing system are not aligned. Â The registration system is a mess. They have three windows, but it's never fully staffed and it's slower than the dmv. Â Every time you need blood work or an XRAY you must register. you get a new account number with a new bill that you need to pay off rather than aggregating total dues under a single account. Â The staff looks very unmotivated and I eventually went to quest because the staff was so slow.Overall between the billing system issues, and the registration, I would opt for another facility as it's become a time sink for you to spend an hour waiting for staff to show up.",3,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Kya Kinney,"Need urgent or emergency care? Â Start here: dignityhealth.org/emergeâ¦You'll be called by a triage nurse. Alternate URL for ~ same thing:dignity.inquicker.com/emâ¦My experience using it: It doesn't seem to change things much. Â Expect to have to repeat yourself many times - even if confusion is one of your symptoms. I arrived at 3:30 - late for my 3:15. Â Checked in at billing/reception right away, told them I'd used InQuicker, and they went and found my completed form, but only after I'd filled out their standard paper form with roughly the same info. Â Vitals taken ~15mins later, and I had to repeat my complaint (symptoms and reason for coming to the ER) that I'd entered and was on my inQuicker form - and had been provided in more detail over the phone to the first triage nurse - then back to waiting room. Â One woman who said she'd been waiting 2 hours, and had only come in because she'd been advised do, even though she it was probably not necessary, gave up and left. Â Another woman who seemed to need urgent care from a blow to her knee / lower leg also wanted to leave without being seen, even though she couldn't walk/ put weight on her leg, but couldn't; she was trying to hobble out using the wall, but couldn't. Â I wheeled over the transport chair she had been in and she accepted and appreciated my help to get to the curb to get a taxi. Â During a second nurse intake ~30 mins later, I had to re-repeat my complaint. Â (During it, I could overhear that a patient OD'ing on some opioid was being attended to, was non-responsive after getting narcan and was given a second dose.) Â I was brought into a bed in the ER. Â I had to re-re-repeat my complaint ~30 mins later to another nurse, and I had to repeat it for a final time ~30 mins later to a doctor. Â He advised me that I would be better off with care for my very rare condition at UCSF Parnassus ER, or Stanford's ER, where I could expect a neurologist to be available who had some knowledge and experience with, and thus could better treat, my condition, plus the St Francis MRI was not open / is not normally open after 5. Â This made sense to me at the time; he offered to transfer me, but we agreed that it would be faster if I just took myself, and was in good enough shape to do so safely. Â So he discharged me with the oral and written advice to head to UCSF's ER, at 5:30 PM - 2 hours after I'd arrived.

Â I have been here three times (first two were about 3.5 stars), and the last time which was about four weeks ago, was the worse experience of my life (if I could it would be 0 star). Â I came in for a medication interaction and some emotional problems and told the triage nurse that I was feeling nauseous. Â She listened to me or it seemed like she listened to me. Â Then, she got me a room and another nurse attended to me and asked me what was going on. Â It took me a long time to see a doctor. Â Actually, it wasn't even a doctor who saw me, it was a Physician Assistant, which I now know only works under supervision of the doctor. Â I think she only saw me very briefly because she already got the information from the nurse. Â So, what did she do? Â Or rather what did she not do? Â I never saw someone so incompetent in my life! Â She just ordered me ativan for anxiety and an anti-nauseous medicine. Â Did she even bother taking blood tests? Urine sample? Did she care that an interaction was actually occurring? Â Nope. Â Then I was discharged. Â Because I demanded I still don't know what is wrong with me, the staff was incredibly rude and basically kicked me out. Â Then, because of that horrible experience and still not knowing what was going on with my body, I had to have a friend pick me up and drive me to another ER, where they did do blood tests and urine, and were incredibly more competent and definitely not rude.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Dakota Bush,"Dr Chen-Luftig was a godsend in the ER when a friend of mine needed to pass a kidney stone. Shes been incredibly helpful and so informative beyond any expectation, she was incredibly nice and considerate and addressed tons of issues that we have had in the hospital historically, including inconsiderate psychiatrists and other caretakers who were outright belligerent. She assured us of what exactly should be done in the future, she was helpful in speculating diagnoses of other prevalent disorders, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, she said""I do not think you overreacted."" I cannot say how amazing this statement is and how rare this is coming from a physician. She was validating and humanitarian and she absolutely should be the one calling the shots in the hospital. I cannot stress how amazing this woman was. Seriously one of the best medical professionals I have ever met. I wish I could talk to this woman forever, she was incredible. A doctor who gives priority to the perspective of the patient. Thank you so much Dr Chen-Luftig. And the mental health unit here is extremely hit or miss. Dr Blaustein, this hospital's head psychiatrist, seriously needs to update his practice. He's stuck in DSM-3. He rejected several diagnoses I suspect I had which were later confirmed by every other psychiatrist and therapist I had seen from that point forward. He needs to retire. That being said there are very genuinely helpful people in the mental health unit. Janice, a mental health nurse, comes to mind. The social workers on that floor are also very considerate and make an effort to connect with the patient. Anyway I'm giving this hospital five stars for the sake of the handful of incredible people who work here. For many of the other staff, I would love to confront them on the bs they presented to me every time I stayed here. Belligerent ER nurses, dismissive doctors, etc. Anyway, if you come here understand that you're rolling the dice and you really might get fucked over but you also might get a golden egg.",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

I don't know wtf they expect when they send a bill that says hey, you owe over $400 but I'm not going to tell you for what. They keep telling me they sent one, when I get what they sent, it has no details, only a total of what was billed, what ins. Paid and what I now owe. Not idea what they bill the insurance for, because they won't provide that to me. EVERY TIME I CALL I'm on the phone for at least 1/2 hour. This is ridiculous. So today, to request the itemized bill for the THIRD TIME, while I have my ""final notice"" in hand the woman said, well I can request another one but your account is still going to go to collections, we can't tell you when, or when you'll get the itemized bill (if ever at this point), not they send it out-someone else does that (of course!) but they can set me up on a payment plan to avoid collections.

Harri Curran,"If you are having an emergency I seriously hope for your wallet's sake that you go anywhere but here. I visited the ER in September because I thought that I had appendicitis. A couple of hours, some blood tests and a CT scan later I was let out without needing surgery -- apparently I was fine. I expected to receive a somewhat hefty bill as I used the ER facilities, but not to the tune of $15,000. The CT scan alone was billed at $11,000. Of course, I never would have known this breakdown without my EOB from insurance, as it has been 5 months since I went there and have yet to receive an itemized bill even though I have called St Francis 4 times specifically requesting one. It turns out that if you call billing and make two requests, only one of them gets saved in their system. This is literally what the last customer support person told me! I guess it's just too much for their systems to handle when you request a hold on your account AND an itemized bill. I also learned on this last call that the agent had no way to access my itemized bill while on the phone, so I couldn't even attempt to dispute the charge. I REALLY want to know how a hospital can charge 10x Health Care Blue Book prices, send me ZERO correspondence except for one past due notice even though I called them on 4 separate occasions requesting a bill, with 2 of those calls taking place before the past due notice came, and give me literally no way of communicating with them about the charge when I find other means to even know what the charge is (EOB). Complete robbery and horrendous billing department. Can't wait to pay this bill for the next year.

Ciaran Guest,"My experience at San Francisco Dignity Health SaintÂ Francis Memorial Hospital has been nothing short of frustrating and downright unethical. Due to some new, urgent health issues, I needed to see a GI doctor. I found a doctor at St Francis through my insurance company. Before I even scheduled the appointments (office visit and procedure), I asked the doctor's office what the cost would be both in cash and with my insurance and they told me they were unable to provide that information. After the doctor's consult appointment and procedure in early April 2019 the total fees wereÂ $7,400. I am now told I owe close to $5,000 out of pocket for this routine procedure.Â  When I received these bills, I was in total shock as I had tried to obtain prices before but the facility refused to provide them. I have since done additional research on fair prices for this routine procedure.Â These fees are significantly higher than the $1,714 fair price listed using the same CPT code I was billed for on Healthcare BlueBook. Furthermore, my family then contacted 2 other GI offices in the same San Francisco area, and both facilities have a total doctor's office and facility fee of $2,300 and $2,750, information provided easily upon inquiring. How can your medical group be charging rates of 200-250% higher than area standards?Â Most interestingly, after receiving these exorbitant bills and outside comparisons, I have contacted your billing department multiple times and have been met with very rude, unhelpful staff members. They have declined to make any adjustments to be in line with other General Hospital in the area.Â I contacted my doctor to inform him of what I had happened to me. He told me that he was entirely unaware of the true costs and would speak to the CMO of Dignity Health SaintÂ Francis Memorial Hospital. Last week I got a call from the hospital billing to say that myÂ dispute was invalid and denied.Â  After this, I emailed my doctor to think him for trying to help me. To my surprise, he informed me he has decided to leave Dignity Health for these unfair and unreasonable practices. Even the doctor at your group is totally disgusted with what Dignity Health is doing and is quitting. Given these terrible, unprofessional, unethical business practices, I have given up on speaking to the billing department and am considering other public avenues to warn others of the shameful practices at Dignity Health St. Francis.Note to Dignity PR - I see that you respond to comments, if you decide to reply, please contact me with a direct line.

Public baths are filthy but from what I see, not their fault... kind of a ""homeless wash room"" and it was not long term dirt.

We suspect my grandpa died because of morphine overdose which suppresses his breathing! Yes my grandpa is 86 and suffering for Alzheimer's for many years. But it does not mean we don't want him to live as long as he could with his family taking care of him! Story goes like this: my grandpa was first in the hospital 3 and half years ago due to food got into his lungs and caused pneumonia. The doctors back then dogmatically ruled him that his ability to swallow is none and insisted in getting our family to consent for a gastronomic feeding tube to be put in his stomach. Back then we refused and insisted in feeding him naturally. Guess what he lived 3 and half years longer with the family!  Â 2 months ago same thing happened and the ambulance brought him here again! Same story and ruling from these suck ass doctors. Our family refused the feeding tube again! ( the logics behind refusal was we had 2 relatives who consented to feeding tube insertion all died within a week due to infections!) These doctors got mad saying we are stubborn! And threatened us not to treat our grandpa if we refuse to their suggestions! Guess what, with his 2nd time in the ER this time, they did not do a damn thing to treat him! They did not bother! What kind of doctor moral is that? but just give him mega dose of morphine to kill him without family consent!The doctors there have no respect for life, patient right to choose treatment and downright cold hearted!

Jose Sears,"AVOID THIS HOSPITAL!! If I could give negative 100 stars I would!I've traveled around the world and has visited clinics &amp; General Hospital, and St Francis Memorial Hospital is the WORST and most RIDICULOUS hospital ever. I had food poisoning and went to the hospital to see a doctor as I needed a doctor's cert to postpone my flight back home. I waited 3 hours in a consultation room because there was only 1 doctor on duty that night. Finally the doctor was free to see me for 5mins after my husband had to constantly ask if we can be seen so I can go back to the hotel to rest. The doctor was brisk, unfriendly and distracted because she's overworked. She gave me a bunch of paper on how to take care of my condition. Well, thank you! I could have googled the information for free! I was given 3 pills and told to go to the pharmacy the next day. The pharmacist told me that the drugs I was prescribed is a strong narcotics used for patients who just went for surgeries and it's too potent for my condition! I guess the doctor was really try to make me stoned before I went to pay for the bill so I won't balk at the amount. Because since I am a tourist, I was told I have to pay the final bill of USD615 in full because they are unable to contact my travel insurance company on my behalf as it is not a local USA company. That's a crazy amount! No blood tests, no x-ray, no drips.. nothing! Well, since I could claim from my travel insurance at a later date.. I just paid and left.But that's not the end of the story.. 1 month later, I received a mail (they sent it by post all the way from USA to Singapore!) from them saying that I owe them money! The total bill is actually USD1778 and I only paid a portion of it!WOW!!!I emailed them back and after a few back and forth emails, I was told the following:""We cannot estimate your price when you arrive via Emergency Room, everything is an estimate because the hospital has no knowledge on how many tests, supplies or recourses will be used, so based on this estimate we charge a portion upfront. We also do not charge based on time, regardless if you are seen for 5 minutes or 3 hours, the fee is a base charge for visit, I understand you didn't visit the pharmacy or any other test was performed, please understand that this is our pricing and is reviewed and approved based on market research that is done every year.""USD1778 for 3 tablets and 5 mins of your doctor's time? Â Pricing based on market research? Extorting tourists for money, that's more like it! Even a high end hospital in Europe only charges around EUR300-600 for their emergency services which includes tests. This hospital is charging USD1778 for nothing! They must be rolling in cash! I wonder how much do they charge for serious cases?

Teigan Lloyd,"As an in-patient in their burn unit my experience was mixed. I came in with severe burns and stayed in their burn unit for a couple weeks. During that time I observed some great people doing good work, and some not so great people doing things that had me concerned. I've worked in healthcare for a long time so I pay attention to things most people wouldn't pick up on. My first observation after surgery was that my room was never cleaned by housekeeping. They just came in and did a quick ""trash and dash"". My housekeeper did not wear gloves when handling items such as trash or biohazards waste, and they did not use hand sanitizer or wash their hands when coming in and out of the patient's rooms. This concerned me based on the threat of infection and these folks were containing the entire place with everything surface they touched. I noticed most of the RN's using good hand hygiene, but I also noticed a few who did not.I really appreciated the guidance and feedback I received from the physical therapist's assigned to the burn unit. Being bed ridden for most of your stay is no fun, and these folks did a wonderful job and really benefit each patient they interact with. I had one RN make derogatory comments about me directly in front of my family members. (I still have no idea what her problem is/ was or what I did to offend her)As an out patient my experiences weren't much better. During my first appointment I was forced to wait in the waiting room for 90 minutes beyond my appointment time. Then the doctor rushed in and exited just as quickly. His entire exam lasted less that 30 seconds. My second appointment followed suit, where I waited for more than an hour after my scheduled appointment, before I got fed up and left and abandoned my care plan.

The entire 800 and 900 blocks of Leavenworth have been used as your toxic, unhealthy, unconscious and clearly in the wrong industry employees' trashcan and I am going to submit pictures and my documentation to the city to demand you clean up your toxic mess in our neighborhood or be fined if 7 days from now all those butts are still there. It's bad enough we have to wake up to all the homeless people you release from your ER Â onto the streets every crack of dawn when they have nowhere to go, but this gross mess too?? Please strongly consider nicotine testing future applicants and not hiring unintelligent, unconscious people who put others health at risk because they lack self control or basic intelligence. Even 5 year olds know cigarettes are toxic. Anyone in the medical field who smokes them should not be trusted with any healthcare needs or even healthcare advice.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Thierry Stark,"Wow. What a bad experience. I came in for outpatient surgery. My surgeon and anesthesiologist were great. Everything else was horrible. The pre op nurse hardly looked at me. I was definitely a job and not a person. When I woke up in recovery I was in a big room but basically alone. Two nurses were discussing produce, training they had last week, etc. not sure what I would have had to do to get their attention. Back in the come &amp; go unit. They took me to the restroom with wet floors and said ""don't slip"" to someone recovering from anesthesia. Also the nurse had me clean up my own blood, etc. she left me standing alone on the wet floor. The transport gut never showed up to push the wheelchair downstairs. I will say that the nurse after surgery was very kind.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Eden Clifford,"I ate bad oyster and diarrheal so I visited San Francis Memorial Hospital emergency room at 3/27/2014. The nurse tried to do a blood test for me. However, he was inexperienced and unprofessional. He tried three times over my both right and left arms for over almost one hour. Not only the drip was not successful, he spread my blood and the drip all over the room. After I returned to home, both of my arms were bruising for a month. I was even not able to fully raise my arms for two weeks.In addition, there was significant communication issue among nurses and doctors. During the few hours when I stayed in the hospital, multiple different nurses visited. One of the nurses visited and said, ""Since you told other nurses you are not willing to do any more drip, we have stopped your drip."" However, I didn't say anything to any nurses about that. The information was totally from nowhere! I told the nurse that I didn't understand what she meant since I didn't say anything. She challenged me ""are you sure you didn't say that?!"" My family was with me for the whole time, and we didn't say anything about that for the whole time. After that, few nurses stopped by and I waited for another one hour before they continue my drip.On a separate but related note, I was there simply because oyster diarrheal and got two drips. It's hard to believe that the bill is over $5,500 with over $3,200 that I have to pay out of pocket. I was trying to request for a discount of the bill. At 5/11, I submitted my concern to the online form and didn't receive any response. After I talked w/ my insurance company, I got a mail address mailed to the hospital. No one respond either. I called the finance team left 3 voice mail but didn't receive any response until I followed up again few days after. I talked to the finance person submitted the information she asked for. After two weeks, no response. I followed up again, she said that they can't provide any discount.",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Kim Myers,"Avoid this hospital unless your life depends on it and it's the closest emergency room to you.The emergency room, specifically the individual rooms and bathrooms are filthy. I don't even want to go into specifics on that.Also, we were double charged for multiple services. I called the billing company, who referred me to the doctors. I called the doctor, the ER department head, and the head of billing for the hospital. None of them were available, I left urgent messages, and none called me back. Then, the billing company sent me a letter threatening to turn over our bill to a collection agency (which destroys your credit score) so we were forced to pay the bill.So I repeat: avoid this hospital unless your life depends on it.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Jordon Whittaker,"I actually had a really bad experience with radiology one day. Circumstances aligned to make a terrible day worse. Mercury was probably in retrograde. But this review isn't about that. I received a survey in the mail and I filled it out honestly about my experience. I asked to be contacted. A week or two went by and Tara Piazza, who is the new supervisor in the radiology department, reached out to me with compassion, a plan to rectify the situation, and a sincere promise to do better. I was very impressed with her follow up, the fact that she didn't let me fall through the cracks, and that she helped us get to a satisfactory resolution. Stellar service recovery on the part of Tara. I'd go back to St. Francis despite my first experience based on her service.",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Ayaan Romero,"With such a big hospital, this review obviously misses on most of the departments. Pros (Radiation and Chemotherapy):The nurses and doctors in Radiation and nurses in Chemotherapy are outstanding and get six stars. They go the extra mile in every aspect of their job, especially patient care, so they deserve the extra star. From translating medical terms to making sure the patient was comfortable, every interaction was a pleasure. I wish I could say the same for other medical staff.Cons (Radiology/Imaging):Some members of the technical staff are so rude. They're impatient and condescending. It's like they don't know anything about patient care nor customer service. I'm sure they're good at the technical aspects of their job, but health care requires more than that. Talking down to patients and their family members is absurd.",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Charli Mccann,"This review is for the ER at St. Francis. As far as ER experiences go, I didn't have a terrible one when I was there last night. I was there about 3 hours, which included nurse triage, x-rays, and finally seeing the doctor. They did tell me upfront it was busy, so I was prepared to wait. Saw the nurse after maybe only 30-45 mins and she gave me ice while I waited (sprained my ankle badly). X-rays got done another hour or so after that, finally got in a room after another hour, and saw the doctor some 20-30 mins later. My main complaint now is that they have a policy that they will not under no circumstances call a prescription in to a pharmacy. I left their around 9:45pm last night with a prescription for pain medicine, which I would very much love to have right now. I'm at home unable to walk (unable to go to the pharmacy) and unable to have someone pick up my prescription for me since they won't call it in. Very frustrating. I'm going to need someone to first come to my apartment, take my Rx to the pharmacy, then bring it back. Completely unnecessary. It's for Motrin. What is the big deal. :(",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

An enormous male nurse comes in to give me a painkiller and drop off a jug for, well, what you do in a jug in bed in a hospital. He hands me the jug, puts the syringe in his pocket and walks away. The man kept the fentanyl that was supposed to be injected into my IV.

Camille Whitley,"This is on behalf of radiology. They will get you to sign anything before they do any radiograph and then claim they provided something such as a consultation, bill you for it as a clinic visit, when you never spoke to any physician during the whole process. Â Oh and they charge a good $700 and $800 per radiograph and a diagnosis fee of $50-100. Not paying anything until they show proof that I signed a ""consultation"" document. I paid less for an MRI at an independent imaging office. Save your pennies and go elsewhere if you are able because healthcare isn't cheap and it'll only get more expensive.On the positive, their billing department was courteous, patient and helpful.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Lani Robins,"*slow clap*Wow. Congratulations for almost killing me. Â Your concerted effort at being impeccably uncaring and incompetent was almost the undoing of an otherwise healthy 36 year old. Â  I arrived in a 6000 dollar ambulance ride lasting two blocks to be greeted with the most unconcerned batch of inattentive morons that the health care industry could procure. Â Now don't get me wrong, I truly appreciated that fact that you ignored the excruciating pain that I was in while trying to strap me to a gurney as you attempted to Â stick me in that CT scan without any concern for the fact that I could not lay flat due to the blood that was filling my lungs. And I could not be more thankful for your eye rolling nurses that treated me like some sort of homeless scum just there for a routine overdose. I was completely thrilled when you handcuffed me to a bed and shoved me in a dark waiting room for 10 hours while my lungs collapsed and I neared death when I blacked out. The lack of comfort, care, and general malaise at seeing a mid thirties individual writhe with pain must have been Â a particular high point for both of us in the esteemed service you provide. But I have to thank you from the bottom of my still beating heart that you had the cognitive ability to ship me out to UCSF so they could properly save my life. Â That last part is certainly the thing you did best...you waited till I was almost dead to send me to a competent hospital so that I could receive the treatment I needed. Me and the half of lung that I still possess are eternally grateful that you finally admitted that you are a slack bunch of ill equipped Â pretenders who did the right thing....and sent me to a hospital with real doctors. Â  Thank you. Â Thank the FUCK out of you for showing me how completely incompetent you are so that next time I wind up in an ambulance I know, no matter how terrible my condition, Â that I ask to go all the fucking way across town to A REAL hospital. 200!!",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

The hospital is so disgusting, the floors were sticky in the waiting room. I didn't even want to sit in the chairs. The worse part was when I went to the back and the bathroom had feces on the wall! I told the staff which they were super busy, and they told me they don't have housekeepers at night time!! What kind of sh!t is that! (Pun intended).

Rhian Knott,"I have been going to St. Francis for several years now to see the doctors in the Sports Medicine practice. NOTE that this review is for the hospital, NOT the doctors in Sports Medicine. I love the doctors and their practice.Sadly, I cannot go to see those wonderful doctors anymore. Every time I go, I seem to get billed 3 times or more. One bill is from the doctor, but the rest are for various odds and ends the hospital charges for you being there. I keep getting bill after bill in the mail, and I keep paying them, because, well, do I have a choice?I had a relatively routine foot surgery at St. Francis, and it cost me all-told about $6,500. Again, bill after bill kept showing up, and I kept paying them, and finally at the end of the year, I added it all up. I was shocked. Go ahead and try to talk to them about the billing, or what the charges are for, and they will give you a back and forth with the doctor's office that will make you just give up.So, my recommendation is to stick with a hospital that is transparent with their billing. This place is not, and I think it is safe to say that it's the most expensive hospital in San Francisco.",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Edan Hamer,"Very shady billing practices. After treatment the receptionist said my medical bill for my wife's emergency room visit was $1100 and could possibly be even more. The receptionist then demanded that I pay half right away. I did not know at the time I was not legally obligated to pay any kind of estimate until the claim was fully looked at and calculated by my insurance, which was weeks later. I was more concerned with my wife being okay. This hospital was only legally entitled to the $100 copay for an emergency room visit as stated in my wife's blue shield plan. They charged me $500 that day. When I finally got the bill from Blue Shield, I only owed $100 out of pocket, as stated in the blue shield plan documents. If your plan has a set copay for any type of service, do not pay more than that copay even if the the hospital demands it. It is against California law for them to refuse emergency services due to non payment. Pay your copay and only pay what your insurance actually determines you are supposed to pay. Don't let a hospital tell you otherwise, no matter how demanding they are in asking.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Chance East,"Common wisdom has it that you can get away with all that rough and tumble physical stuff when you're young. Maybe. But the dues you pay later...whoa! So here I am at later, in a moment of almost meditative motion when in comes the dues collector.Snake-arms are a fun - beautiful, even - Â part of bellydance vocabulary. So, I'm minding my own beeswax, imagining (laugh if you must) that I'm Goddess of Time and Change, Kali doing her damn dance. My arms (all twenty) are waving in the air - snakes, if you would. Mesmerizing, terrifying, yet...alluring... I was rudely awakened from this little reverie when one of my 'snakes' hissed. Loudly. I was alarmed, bummed, etc. when I realized that the hissing was actually me, booking an extended stay in Pain City. Ice, heat, limited movement, anti-inflammatories, nothing interrupted THE PAIN. Â Then, over a period of a few weeks, the whole arm/shoulder gizmo started to lock down.Well, nothing's gonna get in the way of my shimmy-shimmy-shangalang for too long, m'kay?!!A check in with my regular doc at East Bay Family Practice and a referral later, St. Francis was on the list of physical therapy possibilities covered by my insurance. Saint Francis Memorial Hospital is okay as General Hospital go (see previous review on the hospital overall) and thanks to physical therapists like Len and Sarah, the SFMH physical therapy department rules! Physical Therapy is located up on the 11th floor and shares space with sports medicine. They have pilates equipment, bright digs, Â and plenty natural light streaming in. There's pervasive air of competence and well-being that some how translates into me feeling cool about coming here as opposed to feeling like a loser for having effed up my body (again).I drug my (increasingly) Hunchback of Notre Dame ass on in. Enter Sara and Len. Positives: They both talk to me about what they're doing and why. Joking and laughter are part of the deal if you like (and about the only way I can get through some of Â the pain on the way to cure) I get CHOICES...well...most of the time. Sara always has this little House of Pain thing she apparently MUST do in the funny-bone-I-never-knew-existed area at the top of my rib cage to get things started. Drat!Occassionally, my inner-2-year-old even gets possessive when I must wait my turn. Outside I'm going ""Oh, that's fine, I know I'm early, I'll just read"" but the inner brat is squealing, ""NO! MY therapy! GO AWAY, stinky poo-poo head!"" Most importantly pain has gone from a 7 (out of 10 OW-ees) down to a 1.5 and will hopefully be a 0 before long. Pretty damn good for a little over a month with even some modified snake action thrown in. Â I honestly thought I was gonna have to hang up my belly dance pants for good when I got started, but the snakes are back in effect and with the info I got from Len along with the ice, stim and assorted therapeutic hands-on I got from both him and Sarah, I'm almost out the door.Ah! I almost forgot. Â The ONLY reason this isn't a five Â star deal is probably something that can't be helped. Scheduling appointments can be a headache. If you ain't quick (and even a leetle beet pushy) it can be hard to get in Â the requisite amount of therapy due to lots of other people wanting the same great treatment in the same great place.

Troy Moran,"Terrible experience all around at the ER for a Kidney Stone emergency, with the following low lights:- When I arrived at the ER, the taxi driver went in to ask if someone could come out with a wheelchair. 10 minutes later, when no one came out, I decided to (gingerly) walk in on my own rather than waiting- Even though I'm doubled over in pain, registration couldn't have been less caring. They were very casual and more focused on getting my email address than actually getting me to a doctor.- Three house into the visit, the nurse lets me know that drinking is the most important thing I can do. Meanwhile I've been off an IV and not given anything to drink for 2 hours.- Frequently the curtain was drawn and no one checked in, so they had no idea how I was doing- After three hours of almost constant pain and nausea, they let me know that I'll need to leave because they need the bed. A doctor, who I hadn't seen until then asks what they can do for me, which totally mixes me up because I've been there for hours. She comes up with the brilliant idea of giving me pain killers. Of course I've been on pain killers for hours, which hasn't helped. She then asks a few more silly questions before letting me know that she doesn't know anything about my case. I'm amazed that she hasn't taken a moment to get background info before spouting nonsense to someone in a great deal of pain.- That doctor, along with my nurse, who has constantly been contradicted by others in the ER, then let me know that I'll be safer in my hotel than the ER, so I should check out. Keep in mind that it's 1 am, I'm still in pain / nauseous and have challenges walking. So, I'm amazed that they think it'll be safer for me to walk to get a taxi, take a 20+ minute taxi ride to a 24 hour pharmacy, wait 20+ minutes for medication, take a 20+ minute taxi ride back to the hotel, walk through the hotel to end up in a room by myself rather than being in their ER!!!!! In the end, given how bad my experience was in the ER, I decided that I would actually be safer on my own.- They didn't prescribe Flowmax, so the kidney stone took longer to pass- Three days after leaving, my pain killer prescription was out. I tried to speak with a doctor at the ER about extending my prescription a few days, since my understanding is that they sometimes prescribe up to 7 days of medication, but the receptionist refused to let me speak with a doctor and hung up on me.JUST A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Â It was a few minutes later that we were brought inside and she was hooked up to IV's and started to settle in. Â She was seen by several nurses and a hospitalist within a short amount of time.

Â Spent 2 nights in the hospital, and overall, I think she was well cared for. Â Definitely needed to remind some of the medical staff a few times (""You unhooked her IV so she could eat dinner; she needs to be hooked up again.""), but I don't think they were being remiss or unattentive (just busy).Overall, a quality experience, and if I had to choose an emergency room again in SF, I would probably put St Francis at the top of the list.

I will review the ER and the Hospital separately.Bare in mind this is my first ER&amp;Hospital encounter in the US so I can't compare.ERThe wait time was very good. I was seen by a doctor in around 15mins or less. Everyone was very polite and professional. They did a lot of tests, even a spinal tap and I think they did an amazing job. Within few hours I was diagnosed with meningitis (a very rare disease) and hospitalized. Overall rating of ER - 5/5. Fast, efficient, everyone very friendly (doctors, nurses, administration).HospitalI was hospitalized in a private room and I asked if my wife can be with me. They agreed and even provided a bed for her so she can sleep next to me, which was a great deal of relief for me, given that this was my first time being hospitalized and it was for a disease that had 37% mortality rate. Just allowing my most loved person to be with me made a world of difference for my emotional state. The room was small, but clean and they provided me with blankets, pillows, personal hygiene accessories, TV and free high speed wifi. I had a private bathroom and shower too.The nurses were great. Very friendly, always asked me if I need anything, if I am in pain etc. I noticed that calling for a nurse will sometimes take them long time to come (like 15-30min) but I guess they were just very busy.My biggest complaint would be the bed - it SUCKED! Prior to they hospitalization I had a spinal tap procedure which has super strong headache as a side effect. The bed was so uncomfortable that in a few hours my back would hurt more than my head and let me tell you - the head hurts a lot!

Joy Perkins,"This hospital has an extortionate pricing model. Â My wife went to her podiatrist, then needed to get a toe x-ray. Â They could not tell her the cost in advance. Â Later, we were sent a bill for over $800 for the toe x-ray, more than 5 times the median cost in San Francisco. Â  When we disputed this charge, they never responded and sent the account to a collections agency. Â When I called they claimed to have reached out to us via phone, but we never received any messages. Â They also said they do not send anything in writing regarding a dispute, but told me verbally that price is not a valid dispute.

Lenny Chase,"pretty good ER. very easy access from Marin by boat, ferry or water taxi - quicker and more pleasant than the dreaded big General Hospital like Marin General etc. I had to come here for Kidney stones, not fun but you may as well make the best of it. They do not have telephones or any T-Mobile coverage which makes for a real panic situation for family, however if you are conscious they will give you WiFi and a lap top so you can get in touch with family plus you can roll out to a phone some time if you are not tied to an IV. They have TVs in the ""room"" where you can watch the Giants.Even better - this place is hospital to the SF Giants and I just had a sighting!!! Everybody is all excited. But I don;t know much about baseball except that it was one of the Giants fellows.If they had phones or iPhone chargers or open WiFi I would give them 5 stars; If I didn't have kidney stones I would give them 10000 stars but what can ya do.Lap top is key to entertain you as it is really unpleasant listening to all the suffering going on in the ER including my own. Thanks to the nice staff here for fixing up the boo-boos",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Jeevan Levine,"This review is as a result of balances going back to 2009 which remain unresolved at this time, and two letters have been forwarded to the entire senior management of Dignity Health and St Francis. Â No Response! Â One of them was a balance with a date of service in excess of 10 years and the incorrect insurance carrier. Â It was later found that this was indeed a billing error. Â Close to a year has passed and no response, Some of these balances were forwarded to Grant and Weber, their collection agency; and to no avail and I find this agency has more than 40 cases filed with the Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General's Office.All the work was done at the Sports Medicine Center.

Oakley Chamberlain,"Avoid their ER, they upcode like crazy (bill your insurance and you for a higher level of service than is actually provided). I got a $3k bill for a quick ultrasound and about 5 minutes of discussion with the doctor - the $1,300 to perform and read the ultrasound was steep, but the $1,800 bill for the ER visit to have the doctor to poke me in the leg a few times and give his opinion was inexcusable (and wait a few hours in between his visiting other patients).

The new doctor came and my mom explains again her pain and he wants to prescribe her stomach medication. She refused and said she's not hurting her stomach. No one came by to change her and let her urinated on herself. I had to help her with everything. This is a terrible place. They definitely do not care about you and your health.

Lennon Shields,"IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE MEDICAL ATTENTION YOU OR A LOVE ONE RECIEVES, DO NOT COME HERE!!!This review is for the emergency room. I don't know how many people believe that the administration staff is the face of the company. Well I do. I've done plenty of admistrative work and worked with many wealthy people to know this. My review is on the poor service I received from Carmen with the glasses, who sits in the front and the reason why I or anyone else I care about Â will never be attending this medical facility again, if I can help it. I'm fortunate I can make this decision thanks to a wonderful PPO plan. Lets start with arriving after my mom's anxiety attack and her temporary memory loss. Fast forward...Dr. Pearl sees my mom. (She was fine. Not the best... but fine...nothing wrong with her.) Then...Carmen comes in asking my mom to sign liability papers and financial agreement papers. I ask Carmen, what are these and may I sign these for her, I'm her daughter and she is hysterical and incoherent right now. Carmen says sure. (Does anyone think this is wrong?!?!?!....My mom has temporary memory loss - medical term transient global amnesia..she was in no position to fill out anything because for the rest of her life she will not remember this event.)Then I'm wondering why this was given to me while I'm in the ER... don't know if this has happened to any on you...but its never happened to me in an ER before. I asked Carmen and she got defensive. Then I asked may I read them. She says sure while she is watching me like a hawk. This liability form had numbers on it. She was already turned to the last one before explaining to me what I needed to sign. She had papers there that a patient is not suppose to see in that clipboard due to HIPPA regulations. However, before handing me this she should have explained that to me and not snatch it out of my hand. Not only that then she told me I owed her $50. I know for a fact that I don't pay for anything for any visit until insurance bills me. Something was definitely wrong right here because 2 weeks later the bill arrived and I owed less than the $50 she claimed I owed. Next day I called her manager Priscilla who did not return my phone call until I escalated this issue about patient care to her director which means 3 days later. I'm sorry but if you care about the medical attention you receive it will have to be elsewhere. I'm not sure where but this place is simply not it. This hospital use to cater to the elite of Nob Hill and Pac Heights but that has long since changed.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Rayyan Alexander,"This hospital by far Â gets a 1 at the most. I can't vocalize enough the experience my mom and my family has been put through. My mom was admitted last Tuesday, no one person contacted family members to let us know she was there. My mother of course didn't want us to worry so she kept silent. Â Found out Friday night she was going to have surgery the next day. No one could tell us in detail what was going on. Where does the line of communication start???Following day, surgery then my mother was moved to another floor. This was only the beginning. Last Saturday until today when my mom was discharged, it was frustrating and the level of service provided by the few nurses themselves, Mary, Rose, Sigrid and Susan on the 6th floor did not care about my mom's well being being her first major surgery. I am appalled by their attitude and it could be they were selective of whom they chose to give their attention to. I felt like we were being discriminated because of our color and asking the most simple requests. No sympathy for the condition my mom was in. How many times did we push the nurse call button and no one came until my mom rolled out of bed herself, laying there in pain and no meds yet, going to the nurse station and not even a pleasant ""how can I help you"", asking a general question such as a cup or even to substitute a food, everyone carried on doing their own thing. At times, they would speak in their own language, nod their head or roll their eyes then laugh while I am staring right at them! I knew they were irritated with me but I didn't care. That's their freaking job!!! If you don't enjoy what your doing, go somewhere else! Less talking and sitting on your ass and more support. I do wonder if they were in my situation, where would their comfort level be and when is enough is enough!As days gone by with me being there daily watching every single move, it got worse and worse. My mother was starving, started with ice, then the last 2 days before discharge, just clear liquids. I understand it all depends on the doctor's recommendation. Even the on call surgeon whom did the surgery had no intention to meet the family or consult with us about the procedure. Shocking but true. Gave us no answers to questions we had. Said he didn't care if we want to go with a second opinion meaning he doesn't care about the patient! My mother was lying in her own feces!!! No one nurse wanted to deal with her or cleaning her up. My mother wiped herself. I watched and seeped as I saw how my mother was being treated. Trust beyond this level is not highly suggested. The staff does not provide Dignity Health Care, it is their paycheck they are there for!!! Unbelievable...The doctor even wrote up painkillers that contained an allergy reaction my mom would be affected by. How is that??? I will make sure my mom receives the best care moving forward. It was their job to keep my mom comfortable, safe and attended to as with other patients. I would never place any family member in this environment.

Pearl Roberson,"I had surgery done here in Jan. 2013 and all I have to say is, when getting treatment here, be on your toes. Do not be afraid to speak up if you need something, if something hurts or feels uncomfortable, and certainly if you know something should be done a certain way. If you are discharged and have any questions, call your doctor or the hospital and do not rest until you get an answer. They will not offer information. In terms of administration, the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. I have had 3 surgeries now and CPMC is better. Good thing those surgeries preceded this one so I knew what is supposed to happen.",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Kiki Talbot,"I sprained my ankle at 9:30 PM on New Years Eve, and needed to go to the Emergency Room. Anyone familiar with the Emergency Room (my mom worked in one my entire life) knows that most Emergency Rooms don't have a great turnaround time. I made it to the Emergency Room at 10PM, certain that I would be ringing in the New Year from a bed in the Emergency Room.Surprisingly, that was not the case.The staff worked incredibly hard to get me out of there, and back on my feet, as quickly as possible. I've never seen hospital staff work so hard, and so quickly, to help an individual patient who didn't have a life threatening injury. By 11:30 I had gotten x-rays, crutches, and a boot for my ankle, and I was already out the door and headed to meet my friends to enjoy a great evening. Words cannot express the gratitude I feel to the staff for their dedication. I've been in more emergency rooms than I can count, throughout my life, and this was by far the best experience I've ever had in one, despite the fact that it's the worst injury I've ever had to be treated for. This was my first time at this hospital, and hopefully my last, but if I'm ever injured in San Francisco again I will definitely be going back here",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Krista Regan,"My friends ended up driving me to the ER at his hospital, after a huge car accident -- the 18 wheel big rig that smashed into my compact rental car never bothered to stop after the collision. The pain was so severe that it made me cried so my friends drove me to this hospital, after much cajoling. The front desk, doctors and nurses were very professional and nice. As it turned out, after a battery of tests, the doctors discovered that I had contracted a food-borne illness, which was why my abdomen felt like it was about to explode and causing me to experience nausea and vertigo. I would give the hospital ER a higher rating but for the X-rays and CT scan technician, who took no pity of me -- a grown man in tears from the pain and unable to move (the doctors drugged me to calm me down and to relax my muscles). I had the chills. I was pushed into a very cold metal tray that was used to push me into the CT scanner and they shot me up with dye (which made my blood vessels boil) -- the most horrific experience and I'm wearing a hospital robe with nothing under it. I guess when you are trying to get the best possible CT scans, the technician has to take charge and be, well, merciless. I sure wouldn't want to wish this upon my worse enemy -- CT scan is not fun, especially when you are at your weakest. I feel bad for anyone who has to get a CT or CAT scan. But it's necessary and I just wish the process was more gentle.Everyone is nice and kind. Â I was surprised at how many regular patients in this ER seemed to be local homeless people who check themselves into the ER for minor treatment and often for some food. Â The staff are wonderful about this and know the regulars and treat them with dignity and do give them food.",3,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Corrie Pollard,"never in my LIFE did i think i would have to walk myself into the emergency room of a hospital gasping for breath...... to preface this, I will admit to having extremely bad allergies to dust, pollin, etc. when in extreme, these allergies turn into asthma. After a week of practically OD'ing on my inhaler (which wasn't working!) I could feel my asthma just getting worse. This developed into a deep hacking cough which scared the sh*t out of my coworkers. Which in turn left me unable to sleep...... and also a little delirious. Well, I'm tough so ignored the asthma and waited for it to go away. Didn't happen. Fast forward to last week..... I was walking home like an 80 yr old gasping and wheezing for breath at every corner. I felt like my head was going to explode from coughing. People were openly gawking and staring at me..... I knew the time had come. It took me about 3 hours but I finally made it up Pine Street and stopped at my place to tell my roommate that I might die soon and I'll be at St Francis should anyone be looking for my remains. She valiantly offered a ride, but I declined not ready to be fully defeated yet....... I felt like a warrior as I hobbled up the hill slowly and proudly walked myself into the ER reception announcing I was having an asthma attack. I barely finished writing down my name when they whisked me in and started listening to my very constricting lung capacity. They quickly ushered me into the ER bull pen area, and wow, it was just like on TV! Cool. People were rushing around, ambulances were unloading gurneys of people, it was wild. The doctors and nurses were so nice and I felt bad about some of the ""interesting"" people they had to deal with. (One lady had come in from OD'ing on something and was screaming for someone to bring her a bottle of wine) The medical staff was fast, calm and they worked hard. I was exhausted watching. Dr Ross made me wear one of those ugly hospital dresses but he gave a pill to help me breathe and a little coedine syrup to suppress my cough.... so I compromised. he told me to hang out for a little bit and enjoy the show. It was quite a circus. Finally, after a few hours they let me leave and I walked out alive and feeling as good as new. Whew, now that was a close one.

Ashley Penn,"You've been going to the gym for about two weeks now, so it really doesn't surprise you when you accidentally shatter a red wine glass in your powerful grip. ""Not bad"" you'll mutter to yourself. ""Oh my god your bleeding!"" your manager will shriek.Look her in the eyes and say ""I ain't got time to bleed"". You really don't, because some dipshit just ordered six mojitos. Start muddling!""Oh Jesus Christ"" your manager will go on. ""That's gonna need some serious stitches!""Tell her ""I ain't got time for stitches, I gotta keep my mind on my muthafuckin riches!"" Grab your tips off the bar, smell them, then stuff them in your pocket. Don't forget to wipe the blood off of the bar. Do like in the movies and pour some whiskey over your shredded hand. Your pretty sure they do that to fuse the wound. Since you won't be able to stop screaming, and your hand is now both bloody and inflamed, you'll concede that maybe you should go to the ER. Because of the speed and ease of the checking in process, and the pills that one of your coworkers gave you for the pain, you'll be surprisingly at ease, as long as you don't look at your hand. ""Describe your pain, on a level of one to ten"" the nurse will ask you.""The world is a triangle!"" you'll blurt out. This phrase will surprise both you and the nurse, and you will stare at each other with equal looks of shock on your faces. You'll wonder what those goddamn pills you just ate were. From that point on, try to speak as little as possible. The nurse won't press you for conversation. The doctor will come in about half an hour, sew you up, and you're out the door! Fast and painless!

Rajveer Lane,"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CAN HELP ITMy friend was rushed here from a fire. He had been in an explosion and was brought to their burn unit. When I got there he was in the emergency room. The nurse attending to him was doing everything so half assed. He was just in an explosion, an explosion! He was in shock and not at all with it. She was annoyed with him and asking me if he was on drugs. Are you kidding me??? Have you ever heard of shock??? He needed to go to the bathroom and she just handed him something to go in and left him alone. It ended badly and she was upset that she had to clean up. I've never seen such awful help out of a nurse. Next he was moved up to the 10th floor to stay over night. When I got there he was asleep. The nurse came in and said he needed cream on his face. I tried to nicely wake him up as I knew he would be disoriented when he woke up. Instead of letting me do so, she loudly and abruptly started yelling at him that he needed to wake up for medicine. She then just started rubbing his head with cream. As he looked at me with pleading eyes not even knowing where he was, I had to calm him down and explain where he was and why. She had no concern for his well being what so ever and just wanted to get her rounds done. My friend lost his home and everything he owned in the explosion. He didn't even have the clothes on his back to go home in. He was obviously in shock and upset. I finally calmed him down and was getting him to sleep when the same nurse from earlier, Nef Abat, R.N. came in at 1 am. She needed to give him meds via his IV drip. Instead of calmly coming in and just quietly taking care of her job. She came in, turned on all the lights and loudly announced what she had to do at 1 am. She then proceeded to ask him if the police had talked to him and if the police had interrogated him and read him his rights. This nurse had no idea what happened to him or his story. She immediately upset him and confused him. He was then upset all over again, now thinking everything was his fault. Upon confronting her on her behavior, she became very upset and started to blame me. She said I had had a very bad day and that I was misinterpreting her actions. Asking my friend if the police had read him his rights for no reason at 1 am, I really don't think I was confused. I then spoke with her supervisor, who agreed that she shouldn't have had such a conversation with him. Though she agreed and tried to calm me down it was obvious my complaints were falling on deaf ears. The funny thing was that the other nurses were more than happy to help me get this nurse's name and the supervisor's name. It was very clear this nurse, Nef Abat, was a problem and she had some enemies for coworkers. Â My friend's brother also stayed with him at the hospital and when I wasn't there he had several run ins with other nurses as well. Please do not go here if you can help it.

Finnlay Duffy,"My doctor used the hospital to do a cervical spinal fusion surgery. Â Coming out of surgery I was in extreme pain. Â A mix-up in doctors' orders by the hospital staff severely restricted my access to pain medication as well as my regularly prescribed medications. Neither explanations from my GP or pain management doctors nor from me corrected the problems for over 24 hours. Â This caused me to be in extreme, unnecessary pain, and to miss critical therapeutic medication for a deadly disease whose resistance is increased if I miss doses of medication. Â I must admit that the night time nurses, both in the Critical Care Unit and the Post-Surgerical Care Unit were incredibly kind, attentive, and professional--it is a shame they are hamstrung by the non-functional hospital systems.

Geoffrey Jacobson,"I've actually been here a couple times.. First time was to get my blood tested. They were fast and friendly.. My second time was June 5, 2007.. The day I would never forget!It was another day at culinary school. I loved going to class, especially Plated desserts. The chef instructor was so HOT! I would never miss a day even if I was sick because we only had him for 6 weeks.. On June 5, 2007 @ 1:10pm, I was cleaning my knives and tools and was having a great day. Next thing you know, my SERRATED knife, for those that cook, you should know what that is, the knife with teeth, slid down my left hand between my thumb and pointing finger! Â You could see the inside of my fat tissue and blood was EVERYWHERE! I had to run to my partner and scream for a tissue! It was horrible! My hot chef runs over to me like a hero and grabs my hand with a tissue and clean towel and holds it tight.. I was crying but happy at the same time. He brings me to the office and calls a taxi for me so they can bring me to St Francis...Upon arrival, every one that worked there was really helpful and fast... not a long wait at all. We then went into the room with beds everywhere.. That was when the wait started.. I had to wait, for the LONGEST 2 hour of my life! I was waiting to get stitches.. I was getting irritated and didn't even want stitches but they said I really needed it so I stayed.. Thank goodness my partner was there to entertain me.. So during those two hours, we were just listening to whoever was next to us and their conversations about what happened to them.. Then it was my turn. Finally. The nurse was extremely nice and knew it was my first time getting stitches. She made me calm down and laugh. I was relaxed and my partner was recording me so I was laughing the whole time. The nurse made it painless for me. Thank You! Then another male nurse was wrapping me up.. I had asked him Â if they had Pink wrapping tape thingy and he said he wasn't sure.

And, after a blurry hour that involved ace bandages, ice packs, health insurance cards, calls to ex-boyfriends, and Googling various combinations of the phrase, ""Can I take Vicodin with Topomax?"" I found myself in the ER of Saint Francis Memorial.And it was quite wonderful.My expectations: blood, dirt, methadone, and random bums chilling in the waiting room (we are right next to the Tenderloin, after all).The reality: clean facilities, friendly staff (who seemed unphased by the fact that I brought my health insurance card, but *no* other form of ID in my drugged-up stupor), and short waits. I was in an out (in a fancy-ass wheelchair, no less) within 90 minutes: triaged, ex-rayed, bandaged, medicated (again), iced, (co) paid and ready to face the world on crutches.

Tayler Michael,"This is a serious review.Today while in a lunch meeting with my agency I experienced the scariest thing which has happened to me in a long time: An unexpected allergic reaction to something - I still have no idea what - which caused me to suddenly become unable to breath and break out in hives.I am a kind of allergic girl - I do have a long list of things which cause me to have asthma attacks (could I BE any more of a Poindexter?) and cause me to be sickly. Â So, I am very careful about what I put on and in my body... for this specific reason.It was quickly determined that I needed medical attention - being embarrassed by this display of weakness in front of press and my colleagues - I decided to jump in a cab and just hie myself hence to the nearest ER.In the cab I started to panic as I was trying to get in touch with various emergency contacts (my family is in the Midwest and not accessible to me for occasions such as this). Â When I got to the hospital the cabbie dropped me off at the wrong entrance. Â Which caused me to panic more.By the time I found my way inside and found someone who could help me find the ER I was clearly hyperventilating and crying. Â A sports medicine doctor interrupted her lunch to walk me to the ER and find someone who could give me immediate attention.I was taken straight back - the RNs were friendly, calm and comforting. Â  The doctor (Dr. Piccinni) was professional, reassuring and knowledgable.They quickly assessed my problem and started remedying it immediately. Â They allowed me to explain why I was anxious about how I was feeling; and, they reassured me that I would be fine. Â They allowed me to call my family from my cell phone - as well as calling my best friend (who was on her way across the Bay Bridge to attend to my emergency for me) and my office.The staff checked in on me frequently and kindly. Â I was very impressed with how quickly they figured out how best to communicate with me; and, the expediency of their diagnosis and treatment. Â They clearly explained exactly what they were doing during every step of the treatment and clearly explained what/how I should be feeling.I have to say - Dr. Piccinni and his staff made what was a scary, horrible situation much easier for me. Â Though they were not able to determine exactly *what* had caused me to go into anafalctic shock - they gave me thoughts on what *may* have caused the reaction (anchovies in my salad dressing, dyes or fillers in a new vitamin I've been taking.) Â And, though I feel pretty worn out and still a little sickly several hours later - I am confident in the treatment I received; and, that I will recover due to that treatment.So thank you to the St. Francis ER staff - and, thank you to the un-named Sports Med doc who helped me find where I needed to go.I hate General Hospital &amp; avoid them at ALL costs... so, it says something that I give this one five out of five stars.",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Rebekah Callahan,I was in SF for Cisco Live 2014 when I experienced what felt like a heart attack. Â Turn out to be pneumonia. Â  The E.R. staff was professional and friendly.

Miller Workman,"I just went to their ER last night for the first time. I have to say, if it's possible to have a pleasurable experience in an Emergency Room when you're feeling like hell, this would have to be the best I've ever experienced.They had me registered immediately and in a room within minutes for severe abdominal pain, vomiting for 48 hours straight, and other really awful symptoms.I was given an IV with anti-nausea meds and morphine right away, in addition to tests and exams. The entire process from start to finish took about 3 hours. Amazing!The doctors and nurses were all extremely helpful and kind. They seemed to really give a shit about my well being.

Â They were very polite and professional throughout the conversation.However, it still didn't change the fact (which was confirmed during our conversation) that the physiotherapist billed me for two procedures that took 15 minutes each. Â Total charge: $172 for 30 minutes of treatment. Â In total, $300+ for a 50-minute visit with a physiotherapist. Â Wow. Â Skyrocketing insurance premiums suddenly make a little more sense...I guess I'm partially at fault for not confirming their billing rates and not understanding that you will receive bills from both the facility and the service provider when you visit St. Francis.

Rima Devlin,"I had a surgery performed here on March 2, 2012. I must give a BIG THANK YOU to the entire staff. I can't remember all the names, but going into pre-op Attyna was so accommodating I felt like I was at a 5- star hotel for a minute. My anesthesiologist Justin, was on top of the game. My surgeon Dr. Richard Sherwood was on time and came to see me and talk to me to make sure I was comfortable. The most impressive thing.......if anyone second guesses the facilities at St. Francis? Let me tell you, they have the MOST impressive Operating Room! Wow! Super high tech, state of the art, computers, flat screens, monitors, unlike anything I have seen on TV. It was so clean and uncluttered, I felt like I was on a set of a sci-fi movie. The staff told me they had a major remodel about a year ago, and because they do so much for the City, they had a good dose of some funds. I don't remember anything after that. The drugs kicked in.When I woke up in the recovery room, Karen and Susan were so helpful, I wished I could have taken them home. Bottom line, the Staff at St. Francis show compassion. Many times in General Hospital, I felt some of the workers feel a patient as just a number. The lack of sympathy could be ridiculous. This does not happen here. The people at St. Francis show that they enjoy their work and they enjoy making their patients happy during a crisis. 2 words, Â They care.",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Ellis Dotson,I hate General Hospital. This one is a newer building. They did a good job with the architecture. Unlike most General Hospital in the city this is not an eyesore. I came here to the ER for a deep glass cut to my elbow. They took X-Rays for no explainable reason... And charged me a fortune. I was disappointed in that sense... But happy with the doctor that stitched me up. Although I am sure I was charged about $100 for the extra band aid I asked for. I'll make sure not to have any accidents for awhile... An ER visit is not cheap!,4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

I circled around for twenty minutes, up and down hills, round and round cause of stupid one way streets before I was able to find parking. Granted, it was a Saturday night, but still! Thirdly, the security guard that was manning the doors disappeared by the time we left around 8PM. Um, please do your job and watch the doors.

I get in a room, and while changing into a gown, I overhear a rude nurse yelling at a patient, telling him to get out of a wheel chair. (What?)Next, when I see the doctor, he basically makes me feel like I'm wasting his time and totally capable of bearing the pain I was in at 1 in the morning . (Apparently, because I wasn't dying, my problem wasn't serious, which I understand, but I was still in a lot of unreasonable pain)And then they prescribed me weak medication, which would be the equivalent of taking candy.Very disappointing, because I had two finals that day and I could've really used some relief.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Kiah Simons,"I live alone on probably the steepest hill in San Francisco with the most stairs. Â Not the most convenient place to fall and sprain your ankle while clicking down the stairs to work in high heels.

Â I've been in quite a few ER's in my day, (due to other freakish occurences and strange illnesses) but apparently this hospital is ground zero for the peanut gallery convention. Â Maybe it's because it was the end of the month and San Francisco's homeless population was low on funds, but I've never seen people just hanging around a hospital just because they had no other place to go. Â Anywho, minus one star due to the new doctor. Â It was her first day at St. Francis and she seemed a bit frazzled, but she wasn't listening to my answers to her questions. Â All in all, they had me in, medicated, diagnosed, splinted up, and out lickety split. Â That's all I ask.",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Sion Gibbs,"I was charged $27.00 for walking in here ""after hours,"" which occurs between 10:00 PM and 8:00 AM. I'm sorry, but can you really tell your agonizing pain that woke you up at 3 AM to wait 5 hours? The answer is no, you can't. If nothing else in this world should be easily and (relatively) freely available and accessible 24 hours a day it should be the gosh darn emergency room. That and my astronomical bill aside, I was pleased with the decent care I received at this hospital for a nasty infection nestled deep within my digestive system. The nurses remembered my name, pumped me full of pain medication, and turned on the TV for me because I was happily incapable of doing anything except enjoying the sudden departure of my pain. And if that weren't enough, my doctor was super cute. I regret that our conversation was mostly about my bowel movements.",3,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Carmel Molina,"My husband required major, life-saving surgery and I am very impressed with the service we received at St. Francis. We arrived at emergency at 8:30am and he was in surgery by 2:00pm. The nurses--especially Rose Eberlas--were fantastic the first three days we were there. They let me stay, even getting me a cot to sleep on so that I could stay in the room. We had a private room and the most amazing view--I kept telling my husband that it was like staying at a hotel. Granted, under very stressful circumstances.My only complaint is that the nighttime nursing staff was a bit scattered. One nurse came in the morning before hubby was discharged and wanted to put in a new IV. We said, no, we're leaving today. She comes back and insists that hubby needs an IV. He's already had 4 at this point and is pretty needle weary, so again we refuse. She comes back a 3rd time and hubby almost lost it. Another nurse kept coming in to say that she needed to draw blood and then would giggle and say, oh, I mean take your vitals. She was the one who kept insisting, in a very insincere way, that she really cared about my husband's health. Then she would mess up about three things and then abandon us for the night. I have to say that I was really glad that they let me stay so that I could take care of hubby overnights--and alternatively very upset that I had to be there for him because the nursing staff was flaky. Overall, very good surgery--the surgeon was excellent and hubby is recovering well. I understand that there's a nursing shortage, but some of the nurses are flaky, inexperienced, and downright scary at times. Maybe more training is in store.",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Tobi Mcloughlin,"The plus side- everyone is very polite and there is minimal waiting time. You are seen quickly but the time you are seen is the same as any other factory medical approach in the US like 5 minutes. Five min in Er to triage, five more min to a room a few min to see a nurse in the room then done in less than an hour which is great . BUT it was too hasty. Having papers given to me with out much explanation, or even time to ask questions.I went in for a work injury. I was told to not go on an evening when I could have went to the ER by the employer. The 1099 bush st building is not clearly marked, you have to guess if it it is the correct place and forget about calling. The girl answering for the dept was clueless and transffered me out three times then chastised me for not calling the dept the proper name when I was told by the ER to ""call this number for Physio therapy"".I ended up reading the sheet to her and she had the nerve after chastising me to then tell me she knows what the sheet says. Ugh. I try to set up an appointment time and she has little interest in communicating with me that it is a drop in clinic and I make an appointment with her that actually was not an appointment. I finally get to see the Dr. the next day after not seeing one in the ER the night before. Thanks again to modern practice for not even seeing a DR in the ER with a spinal injury!!!Injured on Saturday, not able to get seen til Tuesday then rushed through then the only time we have left to schedule for physio is at one time slot for the week, Solution, their website needs updated to have the work injury clinic listed. Their staff needs training on the phones to communicate not get rid of clients. It would have been great if the Nurse was a DR in the ER who could tell me more than what I have told him. It would have been great to have the DR give me some assessment on the current status of my spinal injury.I guess there is no happy balance in medicine and you have to choose nice, clean, quick over clarity, quality and treatment. At least the scales here offer something positive over sf general.I am not sure if I trust them enough to not get over charged now that I read the reviews....",2,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Â My options were to go to an urgent care facility ($60 copay) or an emergency room ($100) at one of the General Hospital that my insurer, CareFirst BlueChoice, participates with.I read about St. Francis on yelp, and chose it over the urgent care facility in the area which received poor reviews. Â I expected I would have a line and a long wait at the ER, but nothing was further from the truth. I was the only one in the waiting room when I arrived at 2pm on a Wednesday.The process was efficient, staff were grounded and positive, excellent listeners, and conservative practitioners (appreciated). Dr. Nadius and the male nurse who checked me in both had me feeling very comfortable, wholly heard in a complex (double-infection with chronic history) situation, and took the time to answer all of my questions and advise on matters that were related to my visit, but not immediate priorities.

Â With each ailment, they fully examining you, explaining as they go what they are testing or looking for. If you need follow up tests (xrays, MRI, etc.), they explain what the options are and why they recommend those tests. Â Fortunately, you can get all of them done in the building. Once they have identified the issue and come up with a solution, it may involve PT and if so, you are in luck - they have a PT group attached which have been excellent (particularly Matt who I've used for the past few issues). Â One thing which I like and respect, however, is that for certain portions of my treatment, one doctor actually recommended that I go to a PT at another establishment because she was better and somewhat more aggressive on rehab, which I needed for my timetable. I have no hesitation in recommending St. Francis to anyone and have sent friends there who have been pleased.

Â Normally I go to St. Luke's 'cos that's where my Orthopedic Surgeon is, but the last time I went to the ER there it was to take my husband in for abdominal pain and that was a 6 hour trainwreck of misery and fail.My visit to St. Francis didn't start off on the right foot. Â As I stood shivering in shock and unable to form coherent sentences, the registration desk staff failed to notice me standing there for a few minutes. Â After my friend filled out the form for me, we went to the triage nurse, who was, frankly, a bitch. Â I was in blinding pain and when the automated blood pressure cuff proved to be too much for my poor brain to take, she got very exasperated and frustrated with me. Â I'm sure had she taken my bp manually it would've been fine; instead, she tried three times to do it with the machine, each time resulting in pain and fail. Â She finally gave up, making it clear that she found me very annoying. Â  Sorry, lady. Â Ever break your shoulder in 3 places?That said, my admittance and treatment in the ER was fast. Â While the Xray staff was a bit like ""Who's on first"" and my xrays were less than optimal, the nurse treating me in the ER was top-notch - friendly, understanding, sympathetic, caring, and concerned. Â The doc who read my xrays and prescribed my immobilizer and painpills was also friendly and jovial - he said he'd run out of bubble wrap for patients like me. Â All in all I left in a much better mood than when I came in, and we were in and out in under 2 hours. Â That's saying a lot when you have a three-part shoulder fracture.Now I get to have surgery to put a plate in there next week... aieeee.",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Dru Matthews,"I'm almost alway impressed at the registration counter how clean and quiet it is, and that there is usually no waiting. Â I like that the hospital is right across the street from my doctor's office and within walking distance of work. Â I have to go there semi-annually for regular blood tests now. Â They always ask if it's OK for an intern to take the sample, and I agree after the last time I asked for a regular staff person, who botched it. Â He missed the vein, causing spasms, during which time he aggressively forced the needle into my arm, causing severe pain. Â I've never been hurt by an intern, who have all been gentle and accurate. Â I want to give special accolades to the staff in the imaging department (I believe they are on the 7th floor.) Â In 2007, they assisted my doctor with EKG/treadmill stress tests, on the first day without, and on the 2nd day with echo-imaging. Â I was impressed by the professionalism and personal warmth that they gave me during an otherwise uncomfortable and awkward procedure. Â The female tech gave me a complimentary image of my heart and even explained how to read the test results, which my PCP didn't even bother to.",4,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Nora Ryan,"After coming here for a come and go surgery. I found myself staying in the hospital. They're trying to get my severe pain under control. While in my hospital room for shall I say a week. I saw and heard many things that struck a nerve ( no point intended) the lack of compassion and care and patient understanding. With that I was placed in a room by a supply closet that all you hear is that door constantly being beeped and opened. Not to mention when You complain enough times about the banging of hospital carts and over. Floor lips like there in a hurry to see who's going to bang there cart the loudest. You ask them nicely to wheel things around quietly and that doesn't happen. They constantly come in your rooms and wake u up, even if you are trying to recover yourself after having a major surgery. Â They just don't listen to patients. I found 3 nurses that were helpful and understanding, but when they were off the clock and gone home. It became time to go back to lore hell. Heck some nurses just barge in at midnight into your room and turn on lights and stat banging things around even tho your sleeping and trying to rebuild your energy.

Lenny Forbes,"This place almost cut open the wrong patient, after so much confusion I am appalled. Â I spent the whole day in this place, was admitted twice within 3 hours. Â Every single person I talked to said something like ""This doesn't seem right"" or ""That can't be true"" while either reading my patient notes, or asking me questions I answered truthfully. Â I never saw the same physician twice in the 10 hours I was there. Â I was mistaken for another patient. Had symptoms read back to me that I never indicated, in fact some where the direct opposite of what I had indicated. I am disgusted in the level of service, the lack of sanitation and the out of date technology and lighting int he facility. This was the worst experience I have had in 34 years of medical care. Â Most concerning, was that all my paperwork was taken from me, and wouldn't be returned upon request, paperwork I received from a separate clinic.

Kaycee Cooper,"1. I broke my wrist and needed someone to put a cast on, according to the emergency room doc. . Â After explaining this to the receptionist, she scheduled an appointment for me with Dr. Nguyen.2. Dr. Nguyen doesn't do casts. Â She asked Dr. Lewis to advise her on how to proceed. Â After a quick physical eval of my wrist and a check of the x-ray, it is decided by all that I may avoid a cast, and am sent across the street to get a splint. (Why don't they have splints on-site?)3. BOTH doctors charge me for the visit, each charging about $300.4. Neither uses the billing code that will trigger my insurance to pay for the visits, so I have to pay this out of pocket. I have Aetna, by the way.5. On my next visit, which I schedule with Dr. Lewis only, (I do not know at this point about the billing code issue) I return from x-ray and am escorted by Dr. Lewis herself back to an exam room. Â A full hour and a half later (I was engrossed in my book and didn't want to be a bother) I left the exam room to tell the receptionist that I was going back to my office. Â She got the doctor, who had apparently simply forgotten that I was there. Â The office was pretty much empty at this point. Â She glanced at the x-ray, did not even look at my hand, and told me that nothing had changed, to come back in three weeks. 6. I just got another $300 bill for the visit in #5 above.7. The day before my third scheduled visit, the receptionist called to tell me that Dr. Lewis was not going to be there after all, and that my appointment was cancelled.8.

Anis Cobb,"I had a tendon suture/repair surgery here last week on my foot. Very stressful for me. I am extremely grateful that everyone was so helpful, considerate and upbeat. I mean everyone, and I came into contact with about 12 different members of the staff for this out patient surgery. I can't remember all of the names unfortunately, but as he helped to put me in my friend's car to go home, I promised the male nurse Robert that I would mention his name in my Yelp review. He went out of his way after surgery to get me going, to show me how to use the crutches, and to just put me at ease, to say nothing about how he stayed late and made sure I had all the attention I needed in the recovery room. Again, all of the nurses, and the rest of the staff, were wonderful. Speaking of late, that was the small blemish, namely that my surgery was delayed two hours past the anticipated start time because things were running late from the morning schedule, and then (I am told) the surgery ahead of mine in the operating room I was scheduled for had unforeseen complications, so that led to some further delay. Not the hospital's fault or that of the staff - it was the middle of the holiday season and apparently these things happen. Indeed, I got scheduled for this surgery on one day's notice, so I have no reason to complain about that - just lucky the surgery was able to go forward on such short notice. Â I might mention that my foot surgeon and the anesthesiologist were very professional with great bedside manners, but they are not employees of the hospital, and that may be the subject of a different Yelp review.",5,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"
Noa Steadman,"DO NOT GO HERE!I went to the ER to treat a bad allergic reaction, or so I thought, but I'm not normally allergic to anything. I waited for over an hour, took some of my own Benedryl. The P.A. came in for 5 minutes, pretty much told me to drink more water, don't eat almonds and gave me a prescription for stronger Benedryl. However, by the time he saw me most of my rashes subsided. Month later, I get two bills, one massive one from the hospital and another from the Doctors. Billed twice apparently by different departments that don't communicate with each other, hospital vs. doctors. How does that make sense?

Sheridan Whitfield,"If you're coming here for an emergency or planned surgery, I cannot comment.My review is based on seeing an orthopedic doctor for an exam and subsequent visits plus physical therapy at their Sports Medicine facility across the hall.Unbeknownst to me until I arrived in the waiting room to fill out some forms, every time that I would see this doctor I would be charged a separate fee paid to the hospital. I wasn't happy upon reading that but figured if I left I'd have to pay a fee for not showing up for my appointment. So I bit the bullet. (THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE THIS POLICY ON THEIR WEBSITE, OR VERBALLY WHEN SETTING APPOINTMENTS.)Had to wait a really, really, REALLY long time in the exam room, so long that I was getting pissed that no one even came in to update or apologize for the long wait. Finally the Dr. breezes in with barely an apology and ends up asking me some advice after I tell her my profession! WTF?She diagnosed me quickly, suggested an MRI. Came back for follow-up, thankful that she had conservative approach &amp; said I didn't need surgery. She did recommend (expensive) physical therapy 2x/week. Four months pass with quick follow-up visits &amp; more p/t, when I realized that my doctor &amp; physical therapist don't communicate about my care/treatment and were not on the same page! Got a 2nd opinion to find that I had a moderate problem, p/t prescribed to be done at home, &amp; no need for p/t at the facility!

Kier Almond,"The worst ""hospital' I have encountered. Poorly managed and operated on every level.I write this as I am so very outraged by what I witnessed recently. I work for the SF District Attorney as an Investigator and recently I had to go to St Francis' Psychiatric ward to interview a victim of domestic abuse. I was appalled by what I saw. Dirty beds in dirty rooms in a hidden 3rd floor ward. Broken fixtures. Broken furniture. The patients are basically drugged and left in bed all day without any medical treatment if needed. Patients forced to fetch their own food which looked like it came right out of the garbage. Friends, I am not in any way exaggerating. This place looked EXACTLY like One Flew Over The Cockoo's Nest. The staff is the worst group of unprofessional, disinterested, callous and downright cruel people I have ever encountered in a supposed care facility. It is a shameful situation. The patients have no TV, No Radio, No Reading material. NOTHING. They lay in bed staring at the ceiling for anywhere from 3-14 days depending on how long St Francis can bilk an insurer or the city. They bill 1000's per day per patient. Their website touts ""intense therapy, counseling, compassion, outreach etc. They provide none of that. Here is the truth:1. When a patient is first admitted (day 1) they see a Psychiatrist for about 10 minutes2. Patient is assigned a bed (not even a hospital bed, they look like $99 Ikea cots).3. Patient is given plenty of meds during day. sleeping pills at night.4 Typical day: wake up, get terrible quality breakfast, lay in bed, get lunch, lay in bed, get dinner, lay in bed and then go to sleep.5. Patient may be seen once or twice more at most by psychiatrist even if seriously mentally ill and even if staying the full 14 days.6. This house of horrors literally simply medicates the hell out of patients to zone them out and get them ""stable"" enough to be discharged. I saw patients literally given $2 for bus fare and a juice box and sent on their homeless way.This place is shameful. These patients are amongst our most vulnerable citizens and need compassionate care, monitoring and follow-up.If any decent San Franciscan saw this human tragedy, they would be outraged. Yet, it goes on. I spoke with Doctors at UCSF, Kaiser and CPMC and all said they were aware of the deplorable conditions and did everything they could to prevent patients going their. The problem is that there are only 3 Psych wards in all of SF. UCSF, SF General and St Francis. It is a travesty in that a city so rich in so many things utterly fails to aid our fellow citizens in dire need.

Alexie Cline,"This hospital will rob you blind!I went in for a routine blood draw. I was seen by a student nurse, who had not been practicing more than 2 weeks. This does not bother me, but does not account for the $1000 that was billed. My insurance covered half, but I still think it's outrageous that a routine procedure cost me $500. Especially when I went to have another blood draw a few months later at LabCorp (the place where the hospital sends the blood to be analyzed anyway) and was only charged $134, with my responsibility being less than $10. How can the hospital justify this?! And there is no recourse. If you call and complain they will simply offer to send you an itemized bill confirming their insanely high fees and tell you ""that's just what it costs."" I'm furious, but have no option not to pay.

Claire Tucker,"I came into St. Francis ER on a Friday afternoon with a locked knee. Â I was placed in a wheelchair, waiting to see the triage nurse, for about an hour. Â The ER waiting room was pretty much empty. Â There were no people getting wheeled in on gurneys off of ambulances. Â The nurse triaged patients on a first-come-first-served basis. Â Meanwhile, the longer my knee was locked, the worse my knee hurt, and the more contorted my leg was getting. Â I was crying, shaking, loudly in the ER. Â I'm no wuss. Â I didn't cry when I broke my toe when I was 10. Â I didn't cry when I dislocated my shoulder when I was 15. Â But eventually, I was ready to gnaw off my own leg in the ER at St. Francis, particularly when I was first told I would be seen in 2-3 minutes after being seated in a wheelchair that I couldn't sit in because my leg was bent at some crazy angle.When I finally got seen by the nurse, I asked to be sedated. Â I believe it was at this point that I was labeled a drug-seeking patient. Â In my defense, I knew they were going to have to straighten my knee. Â I didn't want to be fully conscious for that experience. Â And who would blame me? Â I've had my shoulder dislocated (and relocated?) a bunch of times. Â I've been sedated on each occasion. Â That's the way it's done. Â I even asked for some pain medication. Â You know why? Â Because I was in a heckuvalotta pain. So, I was put in the back, in a bed (hurrah), where I was left for what seemed like forever. Â No drugs, no information, no nothing. Â Some 15-year-old looking kid finally asked for my medical insurance info. Â Finally, I got a shot of valium, which was of an amount that did absolutely nothiing. Â When I mentioned that I didn't feel any bit relaxed (in response to the nurse's question about how the valium made me feel), I was told that I had been given enough. Â Fast forward quite a while, finally given some pain medication. Â A bit of relief. Â And then, hours later (when pain meds were wearing off), the physician's assistant decided it was time to straighten my leg. Â I asked for more valium. Â I was told no more sedation, no more meds, because they were concerned about my breathing. Â Hello? Â I'm in an ER. Â Aren't they pretty well equipped to deal with any breathing problems? Â Meanwhile, I'm completely, 100% awake, lucid, and not relaxed. Â And the PA is going to try to straighten my leg. Â I ask if a doctor will do it. Â She says no. Â So here's my situation. Â I've been in the ER for hours at this point of time. Â I'm being denied any more drugs and the right to see a doctor, and my leg has to get straightened somehow, and preferrably hours ago. Â It takes 10 excruciating minutes. Â I'm screaming in pain the entire time. Â Afterwards, I'm a shaking, crying mess again. Â In complete agony. Â I get written a prescription for Motrin and discharged. Â  I get helped up out of bed and handed crutches. Â I've used crutches before; I know how to use them. Â But I can't use crutches at this time. Â Because I'm in too much pain to move. Â The nurse yells at me that my leg shouldn't hurt unless I'm putting weight on it (which I'm not). Â There is nothing I can do at this point. Â I can't get back into bed without help because I can't lift my leg. Â I can't use crutches. Â The only saving grace is that I also can't sit in the wheelchair that they're trying to shove me out the door in because, since my leg is immobilized, my knee won't bend and, therefore, I can't sit in the wheelchair. Â So, I make the orderly put me back in bed and I refuse to leave until I see a doctor, because I believe something has got to be messed up with my knee. Â I finally am seen my a doctor, and by seen, he looks at my knee while it's in a huge brace and gives my 6 vicodin, which is supposed to last me until I'm able to see a real doctor (i.e., one who can take more than 15 seconds to examine me) as soon as I can get an appointment next week.Turns out, my knee is royally messed up, I haven't been able to bear any weight on my leg for the past week-and-a-half, it still hurts a ton, I'm getting semi-emergency surgery next week, and I definitely think the folks over at St. Francis treated me in a way you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

Cordelia Puckett,"My visit to the hospital for an X-ray was pleasant enough, but their billing and customer service sucks!They billed an incorrect code for my visit and it's been a year since my visit and i still do not have a resolution on my billing.

Sammy Merrill,"01-26-2009, at 05:00 I was injured at work. I damaged ligaments in my ankle and chipped a bone in the process. My ankle swelled like a baseball and walking was impossible...hopping was excruciating. My company cabbed me to St Francis Hospital and I arrived at the front entrance at 05:30. There was no one in the lobby or at the front desk at all. I looked around for assistance and found none. I saw a sign saying ""Emergency"" with an arrow pointing down the hall. I followed it down the hall, then to the right, then to the right again, then to the left where I came Â upon two large oak doors, closed and locked. The whole time I was hobbling around the hallways in agony I was thinking to myself ""Why is the Emergency entrance so far from the front door?"" And now I stood before a wall of oak. I knocked, no answer. I was hurting and aggrevated...almost getting pissed off actually. I hobbled back in much pain to the front lobby, standing there in disbelief. I started calling out ""Does anyone work here?"" ""Is there anyone in this hospital?"" No answer. I looked for a ""courtesy phone/intercom"" and found none. A woman walked in the door off of the street. I asked ""do you work here?"" She said ""Yes"" I told her that I thought I was in the Twilight zone as there was but an empty building pretending to be a hospital. She said ""Yeah they quit staffing this area recently"" (""this area"" being the front lobby) I told her about the Emergency room doors being locked. She became very snotty. ""Did you punch in the code?"" I said ""What code? People in emergency situations may not be capable of punching in a code...I didn't see anything like that"" She sneered ""Well, do you want me to help you or not!?"" I thought about it and said, ""No actually I don't because I don't trust this place."" I went behind the front desk and called my company from the hospital's phone and told them of the absence of humanity (and humans). A second employee walked in off of the street so I suppose the day was about to start at St Francis. I used their telephone to call a cab which took me to Kaiser on Geary, where there were human beings working. I would recommend St Francis hospital, unless of course you are seeking medical attention and then you might wish to look elsewhere.",1,Saint Francis Memorial Hospital,"General Hospital, Diagnostic Imaging"

Hayden Mccoy,"I'm sick. It hurts everywhere. Earaches. Cough. Runny nose. Fever. Achey. The whole bit. Being that I recently moved here I don't have a general practioner yet. So I get a recomendation from my chiropracter. Being that we are all located in Portrero Hill, he suggests this place right down the street that just happens to be located in Pac Bell Stadium. I call. They take walk-ins. Very cool. Only open till 4pm though. The front assistant, very cool. I get put in a room. The nurse asks wher it hurts and I say everywhere. The doc comes in. Doc Moi. He doesn't even listen to anything I say. And to top it all off he tells me...I'M NOT SICK! Wtf? Are you serious? He looks at my throat and taps on my sinuses. That's It! And then proceeds to tell me that he can't prescribe me anything because I am just NOT sick. Now, I can understand if I was in the Tenderloin and I was asking for Morophine or a couple pick me ups, but I just wanted some antibiotics or a little cough medicine. Maybe even a Z-Pack? He says take two apirin every every 4 to 6 hours on a full stomache and a bunch of Nyquil. Are you F#C*$N serious? And he was. All this weezing and yucky coughing is a figment of my imagination? The aches and the pains are not real? So I refuse to leave without drugs. I want something. He gives a prescription for Z-pack says don't fill it unless I really absolutely need to and shuts the door on me. That's it. Â I go fill it. Go home.

Sam Mayo,"I went to their outpatient facilities to get an x-ray. In the waiting room, the television was turned up at a volume that made my head ache. I finally asked if they could turn it off (there was no one else in the waiting room) and she turned the volume down by a few notches. I had to ask twice to turn it down again.When I finally got my x-rays, they made me wait about 40 minutes supposedly because their radiologist needed to review it. He never did, and they finally told me later that they'd just send the results to my doctor. They never sent the results either.

Murphy Collins,"Some may have found relief on the 11th floor, but unfortunately---I am not one of them.

Â Now that she had a family, this work was not a top priority.That should have been my clue.The next two visits were with other therapists since Sarah went on vacation (why they scheduled me to see someone who was already absent is beyond comprhension), and since neither of them knew me either, they were not comfortable getting into a full treatment.By my 4th visit, I got to see Sarah again who couldn't remember me, and so she had to start from the beginning. Â I did not go there to talk--I went there to be treated.It was over a month between initial schedulling and my 4th visit.

To my surprise, it was empty, clean with flat screen tv's!! I signed in, took a seat and waited for about 10 mins.

Chandler Lake,"In my experience, this hospital is run by incompetent and dishonest people. I'd advise not to trust them with your medical records and if you need copies, go down in person if you can. I ordered my medical records history from them going back over a decade and ended up receiving another person's records! The person had a name similar to mine but totally different address, state ID and social security number, all of which I provided for them. When I called asking what I should do about it, they were very casual and asked I return them but not to contact the agencies who deal with HIPAA violations or state medical licensing and that they would do if for me. I was suspicious a hospital would report themselves (which they are required to do) but trusted them. I said I wanted to let the person know whose records I received or that they should and they laughed saying it would only upset them and they really didn't need to know. I didn't view the records but did see their name at the top of the forms under my cover sheets that had MY information all over them. I'm physically disabled and had to get assistance to the post office to return the huge package to the hospital. I had to borrow money to pay for the return shipping with certification of delivery to be sure it arrived there safely. It cost me a lot of money out of my extremely budgeted income to go down to mail it and for the postal charges. I mailed the receipts (which I still have copies of) to the correct department and person. I have called since and talked to people aware of this and told they'd call me back. Some of the people I had talked to in the medical records department said the reimbursement would be mailed out that week, that it was taken care of. That was over two months ago. I've called since only to get blown off and no one is taking me seriously.

When we lived here in the city, they cared for not only me and my brother, but also my parents--and did an efficient job of it. Many of the nurses and physicians who work here do not get paid what they're worth, and for them to provide medical services to the indigent is awesome. The parking I found difficult, but the city is known for this and standard for pretty much any hospital or clinic in San Francisco. I also find it intimidatingly difficult to get around, due to the sheer size of it. But updates to the buildings have made it infinitely more snazzy compared to when I went there.

Miller English,"When I comes to my business reviews, I typically stick with my Grandma's attitude that when I don't have anything good to say about a place I rather say nothing at all... except when a business has the responsibility to care for people on a much larger scale. As is the case with my brief ER visit and one day stay at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital for a minor digestive issue.I am NOT going to list the things the hospital has done RIGHT for me while I was in their care simply because there is an expectation of a certain standard levels of care one expects to find at a major hospital and trauma center that doesn't warrant pointing out unless a hospital either exceeds or comes in below expectations (much like you would expect to get food at a restaurant).If you are one of the unlucky people who gets taken to or chose ZSFG Hospital, here's what you need to prepare for:- Very long wait times- Homeless and erratic people approaching you in the entrance area- Loud, often -colored, adult-themed arguments erupting in the waiting area (watch the little ones- Partly due to that, feeling generally unsafe- Being made to feel like a nuisance for showing up with ""your"" problem on ""their"" busy day - A never ending flood of 30 page probably well intended yet completely over-the-top (PAPER) surveys to fill out with pen on paper the old fashioned way (seriously Mark Zuckerberg?!?!) from every department you touched while you're there to arrive in the mail for weeks after you visited (has ZSFG heard of online surveys that don't kill even more trees)- Lots of ""hiding"" being policy and little explanation when dealing with treatment and care plans- Glaring disconnects between MDs and nursing staff- Feeling like you're not being helped or cared forAgain, to be fair, Zuckerberg San Francisco General did NOT ignore me, kick me to the curb or mistreat me! They provided me with the BARE MINIMUM level of care needed to provide to keep their jobs, maintain their licenses and retain their investors. To stay with my initial analogy about a restaurant not being praised simply because of the fact that they serve food (that fact alone is not worth mentioning because that's what a restaurant does, just like we have the reasonable assumption of care when we go to a hospital).I have had brief conversations with most of the nurses and doctors who treated me during my short stays at ZSFG so I could provide them with my honest direct-to-them feedback before I would post my review publicly. I'll update this review as needed.Update 8/7/2019: Over the past month I received three (3) more 1/2 inch thick envelopes from ZSFG - all of them just more ridiculous, voluminous surveys. Again, striving to improve ones business by asking for customer feedback is generally a very good thing, but considering how ZSFG goes about it makes it clear that in their particular case these are simply mindless job-security exercises that have always been spam in my book, but are now starting to become borderline harassment.",2,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

After that, it was really difficult to get through to a person to schedule an appointment. When I finally scheduled a video appointment with them, they let me know I would get the video link for the appointment right before the appointment in an email. I planned my day around it etc. Nothing. They didn't send anything, so I wasn't able to attend the appointment. Add to that that you can't get through to their office, so there's nothing I can do. I called the main line and they gave me attitude saying that they are probably with a patient. I told them I'm the patient they're supposed to be with lol. Â I called their comment line and no one picks up lol. And from what I can tell there's no way to email them from their site. Who knows how much longer I'll have to wait to get another appointment and hope that they'll send me the right information the next time. I am in pain every day. I previously avoided going here for blood labs, and I'm glad I trusted my instinct because this is truly not worth the trouble. If I can't schedule another appointment, I'll probably just go to Youtube for physical therapy exercises to help with my pain. Bad place that can't seem to get it together to do basic things.

Kayden Gomez,"I understand this is a public hospital and they are likely over stretched. I've been dealing with them awhile lately &amp; some of the people have been absolutely incredible &amp; I'm very grateful to them. Other people and aspects of the way they operate can lead one to feel like they're trying to help you lose your mind. The BIGGEST REASON is their propensity to LIE TO YOU. And I've had more than one person who works there admit it to me. One even told me that they LIED TO HIM! So, part of their delivery of medical attention includes LIES!!! This is something I cannot comprehend. How can LYING be beneficial to a person in any way? There are times the whole thing is like a visit to The Twilight Zone. If you're the kind of person that likes to be involved in your care, ask a lot of questions, get names, ask for confirmations. BE VERY PRO-ACTIVE &amp; then still be prepared for craziness.

I'm a nurse as well, but much younger than this woman and I politely told her I didn't appreciate the tone she was using. She then proceeded to argue with me and asking me what kind of nurse I was. Mind you, my complaint was not medication based or any thing like that. The only thing I was concerned with was the way she was speaking to him! I would NEVER speak to any of my patients the way she did. I've had patients cuss me out, throw things at me, and disrespect me and still have never spoken to them in such a horrible manner. My grandmother died of cancer in 2010, before she did she donated thousands of dollars to this hospital and for what?? To staff nurses who have terrible bedside manner? To staff nurses who disrespect not only their patients but their patients family as well? I will never settle for less than professional when it comes to healthcare and respect. The nurse told me that she would give us her supervisors number, and never did. We were told by her and by his doctor that we would get to speak with the charge nurse, and that never happened.

Shoddy, shoddy work.Back in the late 80's I had a friend I'd made in recovery who was dying of AIDS on their AIDS unit. Another woman and myself used to go sit and read to her and just generally be there, although she was in and out of dementia by then.One night she slipped into a coma she would not be waking from. To our shock and horror, it was apparently normal procedure to use the still living, comatose bodies of AIDS patients to teach surgical students things like amputation.We would not allow it.

Ingrid Sumner,"Many Posts about SF General only deal with the experience of a few hours there. Â I went to urgent care feeling lousy and was transferred to emergency then in the hospital for almost a month. Â SF General is like a village with many different departments dealing with things in different ways.I want to offer some convenient tips about SF General...1) You should know all of the doctors at SF General come from University of California, San Francisco. The doctors are among the best and brightest. Â The nurses and support staff are civil service employees of San Francisco County Government.2) If you are in pain - ask your doctor to consult with Dr. Pain. Â Dr. Pain is the nickname for a brilliant clinical pharmacologist Dr. Ed. Â Dr. Ed is the go to man dealing with pain issues. Â The MD's all refer to him for pain control issues. Â In my case pain was preventing me from getting discharged. Â With Dr. Ed's help I got out in three days. Â Usually your attending physician will defer to Dr. Pain's opinion regarding pain treatment. Â My sincere thanks to Dr. Ed for his help - he is a great guy who cares!3) Late Night MD's. Â If you are an inpatient and are suffering you should ask your nurse to call one of the two on call 24-hour doctors who are on campus at SFGH. Â Apparently, they come from the emergency room and cover all inpatients. Â Depending on circumstances they might take awhile to get to you as they also cover emergency and as a regional trauma center SFGH can get very busy late at night. Â I knew one of the doctors from my time in the emergency room and they are among the best at SFGH. Â They are excellent doctors who are caring and compassionate.4) The inpatient food at SF General is scandalously poor. Â I lost 60 pounds while in the hospital mainly due to throwing out almost all of the inpatient food I was served. Â The food was awful and I'm not a foodie. Â I threw it away as it was cold and sometimes stale - the day of my discharge I was served crispy pancakes. Â How stale does a pancake have to be you cannot cut it with a plastic knife and fork?My hint to you is if the food is too bad to eat ask your nurse and often they have several varieties of sandwiches at the nursing station. Â They also often have pudding and jello too. Â Availability varies so better to ask sooner rather than later before they are all gone...5) If you are calling for help know SFGH is notorious for telling people there is a number to call for help at which you will only get an answering machine or a notification that they don't make appointments and you have to come in person. Â I tried calling the patient advocate with a gripe and only got a chance to leave my number. Â I never got a call back from them...The only worthwhile number for help is the advice nurse line. Â That line might have an hour waiting time for being picked up but they usually can get things fixed.6) SFGH can be expensive... Â My inpatient bill was about $37,000 which thankfully was covered by insurance. Â That covered emergency, lab, medical treatment, X-Rays, and almost a month in the hospital.The services I got range from five stars to zero stars. Â I give zero stars to the inpatient food service and outpatient pharmacy (they are jackasses). Most other services were five stars.I wrote a longer review but it exceeds the maximum I can post here. Â So, I hope my tips might make your stay easier... Â If you want a copy of the full review message me...",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jorgie Hook,"I am trying to figure out what else you guys expect to get here, especially since this is a government-funded facility where nobody pays a dime to access different services. Complaining about the hospital is easy but in my opinion the negative reviews are not justified. Sometimes it does take a few weeks to get an appointment but in the end the services you get are just the same as you would get at Kaiser, so all of you please start having realistic expectations and you'll see that the hospital provides the community with the basic healthcare we have been asking for years. I have had a few emergencies and I have nothing to say but wonderful things about the doctors and nurses who assisted me. Since Obamacare became law the general hospital has improved in a way I never thought it was possible, so please let's be grateful for what we have now.",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Korey Seymour,"This experience is regarding a recent visit to the ER. The nurse practitioner on duty, Christina Jee was very rude, dismissive, condescending, and refused to listen to my concerns. Her attitude towards me as a patient was terrible and she needs to learn how to respect patients. She tried to prescribe me pain meds that I had already taken and did not work, so when I mentioned this to her, she simply dismissed me and told me to leave because there was no solution that she could provide. I am not going to take meds that don't work and that can't be the only solution they have available. The people who usually go to general hospital tend to be lower income individuals on Medi-Cal, or the homeless, however, I am a paying member as this insurance is not free for me. Regardless of how much you pay, every patient deserves compassion, especially when they are in severe pain and are not able to function. I spent 5 hours in the ER, 3 hours in Urgent care, and 2 hours in the pain clinic over the past few days. As of today, no solution and the severe nerve pain in the my leg that keeps me up at night is still there.The gentlemen at the front desk who was checking in patients (do not remember his name but he was Caucasian, middle aged, and had a beard or mustache) was terribly rude as well. I asked him to disinfect equipment that did not look particularly clean and the patient before me did not look clean, and he started swearing under his breath. I have never met ruder people in any hospital. I understand this hospital deals with a segment of the population that may be more challenging to deal with, but that does not give them the excuse to treat patients the way they do.

Avoid the ER at all costs unless you really need a Level 1 trauma center. I was in a hit and run accident. Ambulance took me to SFGH. I spent 4 hours in the ER, CT scan, and x-rays. Total bill was roughly $35k and insurance only covered maybe 10%. Care was poor.

Marion Cox,"My great uncle came in because he fell and had trauma at 6am in the morning. And I never write a bad review unless it's warranted. I'll walk you step by step about my experience:1. Had to walk through a metal detector where my brother was stopped because he was wearing a belt. They made him basically pat every inch of his body to show the security detail he was of no threat. 2. The worker who was opening the doors for us (cause they all had locks on them) was sweet, but was later switched out with an incompetent coworker who took 15 min trying to find the room my great uncle was in even though I told her the name and wing. 3. We had to constantly ask and tell the doctors of my great uncle's health needs. The communication between the staff was horrendous.4. It took them more than 12 hours to move him to a more permanent room. 5. One nurse in particular in the emergency named Amber kicked my brother, sister, and I out of the room because we had too many people in there even though the rest of the staff said it was ok. She was horrible to work with and I would recommend asking for another nurse if she is your attendee. 6. They didn't let him eat or drink anything this entire time. They didn't even give him an IV. 7. His gout is flaring up because he's been laying down this entire time and the doctors are dragging their feet to give him his medicine. 8. UPDATE: they won't even let my great uncle transfer to another hospital even though he's stable and no longer technically a trauma patient. After reading all the reviews they probably want to overcharge us like everyone else.Overall, this hospital has been a nightmare to deal with.

Sharing a triage with drug addicts and drunks with only a curtain dividing us wasn't ideal but oh well, what do want for free?! So this visit was a circumstance that I never thought would happen but that's how life is so you have to just roll with the punches, my husband lost his job and so our health care insurance had just ended.

Kim Bray,"Now that the bill is here, I am able to speak about the horrible service rendered to me at this hospital. Service being the treatment of my condition within the hospital. Let's take a moment to be open to interpretation before going straight to hammering away at others. I entered and was processed rather quickly and had very friendly staff interactions; From intake, verification of sir you're gonna get a huge bill, to waiting room entertainment. Now the problem that I have with this hospital visit came from the detailed exam room. I came from San Francisco State University with a note from the nurse practitioner there. He said take the note to SFGH and they'll take you seriously. Upon entering the exam room, more information taken as well as a correction. The staff had mistakenly placed the wrong birthdate on my ""gold card"" issued at the beginning of the service. After that error was corrected, I was asked in various ways, along the lines of... Do you take any illegal drugs, on drugs when you got into the accident,What drugs are you on now,Finally, do you want more drugs.In my head I said to myself, y'all don't even know what's going on and want to immediately throw drugs at me to shut me up and leave. So I refused treatment and left. After waiting an extra 30 minutes for a follow up appointment.Failed terribly at making the appointment. Failed. When the nurse got back, I requested my documents and exited.Stopped by the billing and asked if I get any documents or records of the service provided and was told no. So I left. Empty handed with a lame corrected SFGH gold card worth the value of this visit; $913. Let's also remember that there are several signs mentioning that if you can't pay your bill there are options; I wrote those at the end of this review. But good luck SFGH! Enjoy the writing and I hope y'all correct some of the procedures within this fine institution. Where's the option...

Joey Herrera,"The eye clinic (4M) needs to work on their booking schedule (ie: OVERBOOKED). Â We arrived at 8:45 am for my mother in law's 9:15 am appointment. Â Mil had her eye exam plus eye pressure checked at 9:15 am by a LVN. Â Then was told to go out to the waiting room and wait to be seen by the doctor. Â Right now it is 12:10 pm and still waiting to be seen by the doctor. Â If there is only one doctor in the clinic then maybe they should inform patients how long they have to wait. Â This eye clinic has no respect of people's time. Â I sure hope the doctor is NOT having lunch. Â I asked the receptionist 3 times as to the status of mil's eye appointment. Â Excuse is there is only one doctor on the floor and and tomorrow is 4th of July. Â In my opinion, basically poor management and scheduling. Â So if you come to this eye clinic, expect to wait 2-3 hours. Â This is not the first time we had to wait beyond 2 hours.

I get easily sick when I'm close to ppl with contagious diseases and I wanted to wait in the empty hallway, a nurse came and said ""have a seat, we don't want to block the hallway!""And after we went through long unnecessary processes we were kept in a tiny room without window and ventilation/ac and we kept requesting the doctor to come, after 40 min finally sb came.

Taran Leech,"Avoid unless homeless or you have severe trauma.I cut my finger with a kitchen knife and went there because it was the nearest ER. Big mistake. I waited for 3 hours in a waiting room where many of the regulars were known to the staff by first names and kind of went in for a checkup to clear up their intoxication. The waiting room was very dirty. Later, a janitor came by with a broom. The smell was bad.Once inside the treatment area the treatment was good and professional, clinical staff courteous.Since then, about 6 months ago, my insurance and SFG are fighting about the price and I get to hold the bag for 90% of the billed cost or so. They are not done yet. I get a monthly bill asking me to pay $0.0. Eventually, they'll ask for the balance and the fee for the physician, which didn't bill yet. I'll have to dig in deep for a short treatment.SF General is good if you have no insurance. This is paid for by fleecing those who have, even though they are not in network in any insurance and insurance companies don't pay very much of your bill. The pricing is between ridiculous and outrageous. Insurance companies only pay for sensible costs.

Alfie Romero,"This morning I tried to call the Cardiac Diagnostics Lab to reschedule my appointment. After almost 5 minutes of no one answering my call, nor an answering machine kicking in, I had to hang up. I called back a couple hours later and again had to wait 4 minutes before someone finally picked up the phone. After determining that I was calling the wrong department they transferred me to a very harried sounding man. He (I think) was able to cancel my appointment, but said he had to transfer me to someone else to reschedule. That lady also seemed harried and after a few terse questions tried to transfer me somewhere else. Desperate to avoid this downward spiral of doom, I asked if she could look up my medical record number to see what my appointment was for, in her department, so that she could help me to reschedule it. However she refused, first saying I should call back in half an hour, then saying she is ""too busy"". Too busy to help a patient on the phone? Wow.Thank you Cardiac Diagnostic Department, While as a team you were spectacularly unhelpful, at least the stress of that phone call was enough to get my blood pumping from rage, which I assume is another of your department's methods for increasing a patient's blood circulation.Let's do it again sometime, yes?

Murphy Stephens,"Literally named after Mark Zuckerberg for his substantial financing of the hospital, yet somehow this place gets away with charging outrageous amounts of money to users - this isn't a hospital, it's a business.

Â Imagine getting charge $750 for an eye exam that would cost you $75-$150 other places. Â Yeah - f'ed up.

Darla House,"Prepare yourself for bad treatment at the Infusion Center at ZSFGH... The staff can be condescending and ethnically insensitive. I'm an Asian American who has a European last name. At my last appointment, the nurse demanded to know if I was Chinese, and if I was, why I didn't have a Chinese name. As if I owe them an explanation! I complained about this behavior to the supervisor. I was then told that the nurse was trying to determine if I needed a translator; what does this have to do with my last name? I am fluent in English and it says so in my medical record. I came in for treatment not an interrogation about my ethnicity.Many of the staff rush to judgment and don't listen to their patients. You have to be your own advocate and speak up every time. Bring another person with you so you have a witness and another voice in the room with you. If you go on your own, beware.

Dale Wilkins,"Several years ago, I had the worst bout of food poisoning I'd ever had in my life. I was unable to eat or even drink anything as innocuous as water for nearly 72 hours as everything would immediately come back up. I got so feverish, shriveled, and dehydrated that I lost around 15lbs within that 72 hour time period, and at around 48 hours, I had started vomiting up greenish stomach bile as there was really nothing else left for my body to expel. I was unable to stand on my own without any support. I had not urinated in slightly more than 2 days.It was around this point that my roommate, concerned about my risk for severe dehydration, drove me to the SF General's ER room. Once there, the lady checking us in basically waved us off, blamed us for making too big of a deal over nothing, and made some crack about me potentially drinking too much. When my roommate pushed back, the lady sighed, rolled her eyes, and told us there would be an 8 hour wait. We looked at her in shock and my roommate made the call that I would probably be better off at our place away from the grim and somewhat filthy waiting room. I'm honestly surprised that this place has any positive reviews -- that was perhaps the most callous and dispassionate healthcare experience I've ever faced, and I sometimes seriously wonder what would have happened had my illness not taken a turn for the better after around 72 hours. I understand that food poisoning/severe dehydration probably doesn't take priority over any of the trauma cases they specialize in, but even a referral to an urgent care facility (reading reviews today, it's only now that I realize that they even had urgent care facilities!) or another healthcare provider would have been much appreciated. Or at the very least, not having a healthcare worker roll her eyes at you and when it's clear that you can barely stand yourself up.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Trying to get your insurance company to talk to them becomes this man-in-the-middle nightmare since neither party benefits from putting in the effort (which means calling many times a day to finally get through). A little escalation to the higher-ups was SUCH a relief, though.In my case, they were charging too much. There are many companies that determine fair market prices for services in a given area. These guys charged about 25% more than local competitors, like the world class UCSF hospital. Really upsetting. It's water under the bridge at this point, but if anybody knows how to negotiate/work around this I would be thrilled to know about it.I think the fact that they predominantly deal with down-and-out people (homeless and low-income) puts them in sour moods.

Jamie-Lee Coles,"If I could give zero stars, I would. My husband went there at 5pm on a Friday straight from work with chest pain only because it was the nearest hospital to his work. They took him back and did an EKG, which seemed ok, and they sent him back to the waiting room. Where he waited for 3 hours. No one came. There was no communication. There was no indication he'd ever be called. Meantime, there was an abusive boyfriend berating his girlfriend over and over and over again, using the F word loudly the entire time, telling her she was a b#tch and that she should leave and he'd have his other girlfriend come and get him. There was a 7 year old girl sitting 5 feet away, listening to this guy abuse someone. I went to security to have them do something, but they barely got in the room and he would briefly stop...only to start right up again immediately when they were out of site. This happened twice, and then they just stopped coming in after I complained. They were incredibly ineffective. They never even talked to the guy, I think they were afraid to. What are they there for, again? Also, when I came through security, I walked through the metal detector, but they didn't even peek into my two substantial bags I had with me. Guess because I am white and female I wouldn't have a weapon? I didn't, of course, but they assumed a lot. There was a homeless person in the waiting room as well and I gagged, the smell was so overpowering. All the while my husband is sitting there with chest pain. Multiple times an employee came out and called someone's name, only to have them not respond. How about calling someone's name who is actually PRESENT? So, after waiting three hours and them not doing a damn thing, we left. We drove over an hour to a hospital near our home in the East Bay where my husband was taken back immediately, given a bed, IV, drugs to combat the chest pain, given an x-ray, etc., and we saw a nurse and a doctor within the first 20 minutes of being put in a bed.

This hospital will ""blackmail"" you and tell you that if you do not pay they will send you to a collection agency in 3 months and they cannot lower your bill because this is how the medical bills are! Essentially, you are at the mercy of their analyst who determines the level of ER care and therefore your bill. And you have no say or are not provided any explanation what justifies the cost or why you pay separately for each test and are then are billed lump sum of 10K called ER Level 5. They do not provide even an explanation what ER level 5 is supposed to be. Doing some research shows that the ER charges at ZSFGH ER are exponentially higher than any other major hospital in San Francisco. Below are the ER level pricing from OSHPD site for 2016. ER LEVEL 5; 4; 3; 2; 1ZSFGH - Â  Â $9854; $4882; $2963; $1385; $463UCSF - Â  Â  Â  $5077; $2458; $1320; $806; $738ST LUKE - $4488; $2811; $1707; $833; $334ST MARY -$6485; $3073; $2045; $1368; $868SUTTER PACIFIC - $4488; $2811; $1707; $833; $334KAISER - Â  $3384; $2890; $1574; $957; $509Even though ZSFGH is a public hospital it appears that it serves only a specific segment of society. But their employees are public servants aren't they!? Well it does not appear so even though your tax payers money pays for their salaries and everyone else who gets a free ride! So if you are not poor and/or homeless too bed you pay for your over-inflated health care because you were too stupid to go to a public hospital expecting to be cheaper. I fully support all social programs that aim at alleviating poverty and have no objections against using public funds to do so but certainly do not support public institutions taking advantage of people in unfortunate situations regardless of their income.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Â They NEVER followed up with my labwork results, so I called them several times myself. Â Months later, still in the dark about what the labwork may've revealed -- and still no follow-up, despite receptionists assuring me someone would get back to me with those results ASAP.Then the letters come, asking me to follow up with my insurance to get the insurance to pay out. Â I've NEVER had this problem before -- where the billing department of a medical center can't handle contacting the insurance providers themselves to process payment and need to rely on the patients following up. Â What the...???Turns out this hospital overbilled. Â Each appointment (30 minute appointment, with one blood/urine test) was billed for several thousands of dollars. Â No results were provided from these tests ever. Â My insurance provider ultimately decided to cover only a portion of these expenses.

Rian Walsh,"April 6th, 2015 Around 3:30pmDuring our Spring break drive up to SF, my niece's asthma started to take a turn for the worse. Â Before stopping at our hotel I took a frantic much needed emergency visit to SF General hospital. We first headed to the ER where, trying to maintain my calm, I Â told the intake that she was having trouble breathing and needed a breathing treatment ASAP! I had all her medical record numbers which I am sure helped the expediency. I hate to think what people go through who don't have insurance. :( Â They quickly assessed her and after 5 minutes had us go up to the 3rd floor pediatrics dept. since she is 15 and the regular ER was not the place for her. (The ER was luckily not that busy, but pretty intimidating.) I wanted to thank the wonderful staff in the emergency pediatric department for handling my niece's asthma attack with a great sense of urgency and professionalism. Â From the ER clerk who registered her in on the first floor, to the male nurse at pediatrics who took her vitals and was the initial person to push for a breathing treatment (tall white guy with glasses -I wish I took down your name). A very special thank you to Dr. Andrea Marmor for her professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness. Â She treated my niece with such genuine kindness and was very friendly. Â I can tell she really loves what she does. Â Also thank you to Dr. Stark who was working alongside Dr. Marmor. He was also very professional and nice. I know emergencies rooms can be awful places.

Nana Byrne,"The GH is a very unique place, this review is based on the service provided on a daily basis and not special operations. Just to be fair to the Urgent care and Trauma surgeons, all I can say that they are the best and most talented personnel in the medical fields world wide. But when it comes to the after care from nursing staff to the facility here is what to expect, Nurses, most nurses carry a very heavy load of attitude which make you think you are to serve them and not vice versa, they are rude to patience, don't understand how crucial prompt response is especially when patiences are in pain. you would call them and they would be chatting with each other, won't respond until they finish their story. I mean they in the health care business where they should be pleasant and ensure you have comfortable stay during healing, I don't think they get that concept. you can tell they are miserable at their job and at home and they take it out on the poor patiences. They bend the rules whenever they feel like and they stick to them whenever they are in a good mood. You try to be nice to them, they take that as a weakness. You ask a legit questions, they roll their eyes. I seriously was disgusted and planing too raise the issue to the DPH. I saw some private bulletins which states their failing score during an audit and that's why they have partnered with UCSF to help them pass their audits. Now I know why and hope the DPH takes an immediate action to correct these problems in such an important facility that serves huge part Â of the bay area's population.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jenna Worthington,"Emergency room. Do not come here, ever. The staff are generally careless, inattentive, and thoughtless; mindlessly serving an organization sick at its core.My most recent SF General story:Last August, I broke my arm and severely damaged my wrist and hand. I came into SF General after a referral from the clinic as the only place I could go with Healthy San Francisco. The diagnosis I got at SF General was careless, to say the least. They took x-rays, but did not notice the fracture in my arm. This was pretty bad, but not as bad as my prior referral here, where I saw Dr Chase. who misdiagnosed my torn ACL as ""fine"" (please see my prior review for details).This time, I had come in for a bad hand injury. That injury has not healed and has crippled me for the last six months.The doctor who saw me, Tina Vu, was very friendly right away, attentive, and attractive. I wasn't rude to her, but I was really there to figure out what was wrong with my hand and wrist. I just wanted to be treated. Tina left.I waited for hours after Tina left. I went to the cafe to get an afternoon breakfast (they were serving a disgusting lunch). And when I came back, I waited some more.I finally saw Tina. I noticed that she was following around blond male doctor, who seemed good-looking. Fantastic. I hope she can find some guy she really likes. But I wanted professional medical attention; I was badly injured. Eventually, an allegedly more experienced doc came to pour sterile water on the opening in my hand and look for debris inside, found none, and did nothing more.Fast forward to this year, and a recent x-ray revealed that I had indeed fractured my arm last year. I thought so!But when I was at SF General and they x-rayed, they said that it was fine; that I was fine; that nothing was broken. But actually, I wasn't fine, and I now have evidence that shows that they were wrong.They gave no indication that they thought my arm might be broken and they seemed to think that I was fine, and did not suggest that I should see an orthopedist.No one knows what's wrong with my hand now, and that hand is persistently painful and not very usable. I suspect that the carpals are misaligned and that I've torn my Palmaris longus. I am trying to pursue care elsewhere, without using Healthy San Francisco and SF General.SF General might be better off if it were completely dismantled from the top, with all business ties severed, and reorganized and restaffed from the bottom up. Fire them all, starting at the upper management, and open it up for a new system.Please read my previous review about the negligent Dr Chase who strongly and wrongly insisted that my ACL was intact and functional, when it was actually torn completely off the bone (and have since had the surgery and recovered 95%).",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Â They did 1 CT scan and a bunch of blood tests, but other than that a pretty standard visit; Â my bill was $22k!! Â For 4 hours, it's robbery plain and simple, and since they didn't take my Aetna insurance they charged me $22 thousand dollars, for 4 hours!!

So I'm posting this 5 star because Jason (one of the ER nurses) was amazing and sweet and understanding. Like I said I went in crying and he put me at ease. While I waited Jason took it upon himself to call another nurse from another part of the hospital Â to help me get seen sooner since I was only in for a bladder infection and all I needed was antibiotics. Â So then I was seen by Bryan who was also super sweet and understanding and he quickly got me a priscription and before I left they gave me my first dose.

Harvie Nicholson,"Basically, if you're going to SFGH it's because you have to, so writing a review is pretty pointless, but I'm doing it anyways because the employees may check out the reviews sometimes and I want them to know how much I love them.I've been going there for about 10 years, and can't go anymore because I got Kaiser insurance. I know I'm supposed to be excited that I'm insured now, but I was getting top notch medical care for free and I'm really going to miss that. Somehow San Francisco has managed to provide free healthcare for its impoverished residents, and that is the best thing ever. I spent most of my hours there in the GI clinic. There used to be epic waits, but they've improved a lot on that front, but there will still be a wait. But you know what? It's free, I don't mind waiting a bit. The docs, nurses, and support staff are awesome, I'm going to miss them a lot. I've also experienced the dermatology clinic, women's health clinic, emergency room, urgent care, rheumatology, infusion clinic, and radiology. Obviously the wait for urgent care or the ER sucks, but the clinicians are awesome. The infusion nurses are wonderful and caring. Dermatology probably left me with a bigger scar than necessary, but you know what? -Free.The thing is that it's a teaching hospital so a lot of your first contact clinicians are residents from UCSF. However, they always consult with an attending, who is also from UCSF, so you're being watched over by a really experienced doctor usually, even if you don't really see them.Anyways, instead of being annoyed at the zoo you have to go to, enjoy your free health care with complementary entertainment provided by the colorful clientele.",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Everyone at the counters is very fast, efficient, knowledgeable. When I was lost initially, everyone showed me where to go. Appointments started right on time (unlike at other private clinics where I used to go), and no one said a word when I was late (unlike at other clinics), and they saw me immediately.Doctors were super friendly, attentive, listened actively, and talked informatively.

Ronny Browning,"I am sure the staff here do their best. It can't be easy working in a high stress environment as all General Hospital are. My understanding is that SFGH is pretty much where they take you when you have no insurance or are are low-income. Â Essentially, it's kind of the lowest of the low, budget-wise I imagine. But I could be wrong about that.This review is based on my mother's experience at the psychiatric ward a few years ago. Â She had insurance but it was crappy insurance and this is where they sent her for inpatient psychiatric treatment when she tried to do harm to herself while at another hospital.The environment at the psychiatric ward is naturally depressing. Â Lots of people brought in under duress. That's understandable. Also understandable is how some of the staff can be short or abrupt. Â Like I said, it must be incredibly hard to work in this kind of environment.My gripe is really with the psychologist who my mother saw there. My mother was admitted for depression and anxiety, combined with extreme, debilitating pain. Her mental illness had been building up for years but our family, having never experienced it, was not able to recognize the symptoms. Anyway, she was there at the hospital for 1-2 weeks. Â My father and I visited her every day. Â She seemed calmer, due to the number of drugs she was prescribed I'm sure. Â (I'm not complaining about that.)But after a few days, she would start calling me to tell me that one or more of the staff members were whispering about her, or had it in for her. Â I thought, what a terrible place. Â How unprofessional of the staff! Â 1-2 weeks later, her psychologist called me and said she was ready to go home. Â I was shocked that he said that because I really didn't see that they had done anything to improve her mental state. Â I asked him why he thought she was better. Â He said, literally, ""She smiled."" Â To me, that was weird because there wasn't much to smile about there and the fact that she smiled seemed insignificant at best and really odd behavior at worst.But what did I know? Â And what I could anyway? Â So we took her home (I don't live with my parents so she went home with father). Â That night, my mother kept telling my father that the police were coming for her. Â Over and over, she kept insisting it, saying she needed to pack because they were coming. Â Only later did I realize that while she was at General Hospital, not only did her depression and anxiety NOT get any better, but she had worsened to the point that she had actually become paranoid and was hearing things that weren't happening. Â The police thing for one, and I suspect, what she told me about the staff whispering about her.The next day, we went shopping for a new bed because she was still experiencing a lot of pain. While there, she tried to lock herself in the bathroom and proceeded to try to harm herself again. Â The ambulance was called and she was taken back to the hospital--this time NOT General Hospital thank god but one in Berkeley, since this time, I insisted on using a secondary insurance policy my mother was on (a better one) but which for some convoluted reasoning, my mother never wanted to use.Long story short (sort of), my mother did not get the help she needed whatsoever while at SFGH. Â I do think the dr who treated her was grossly incompetent and that perhaps the hospital was just too eager to get their patients out of there. Â I mean, even I, who had no knowledge or experience of mental illness thought it was strange that my mother was pronounced a-ok on the flimsy fact that ""she smiled."" Â Yeah, she smiled because she was in a psychotic state!We thank our lucky stars that she was treated the second time around by a much better psychologist at Alta Bates in Berkeley who had knowledge in treating mental illness as well as pain. Â My mother was there for months. I could see her getting better, both physically and mentally. When she was finally discharged, she was truly ""better."" Â Mental illness of course doesn't necessarily go away completely. My mother still sees a psychologist every 2 months, is still on medication (though only a fraction of what she started on), and is still prone to getting anxious over little things, but she is doing great for the most part. Â No thanks to SFGH!I know many people come here because they have no choice in General Hospital. But if you do have a choice, think twice please, at least when it comes to the psychiatric unit. And if you know anybody who is a patient here (or anywhere really), ask questions if things don't sound right.

Darnell Finch,This is a horrible place to ever find yourself. I was in the ER and I've had a couple bad experiences here. Today to be specific it took me over an hour to be seen. Only to be put on a bed in the hallway completely undressed with only an open robe Â where everyone is walking by. They asked me for a urine sample and the bathroom didn't even have toilet paper and there was paper stuck to the toilet. So when they asked me to change into the robe they escorted me to another restroom that was just a bit worse with urine on the floor and it smelled horrible!,2,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Efe Dupont,"for a trama Hospital the care is great. Â Because it's a trama Hospital, there are certain things that you have to put up with that don't happen elsewhere. My issue with this Hospital is their Billing practices. I have Medicare and they have messed up a few bills, instead of fixing mistakes they try to collect from the customer. Â Medicare says this is illegal because they notified sfgh that it's the contractors obligation to submit a corrected invoice. hopefully they stop pushing the law and do their job.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Luka Whittle,"My daughter had a bad fall and the ambulance brought her here. She had a huge team of doctors here who worked hard on here. They made team decisions and communicated well with us and each other. They were very patient with my terrified two year old through exam, CT Scan, and eventual admission into the hospital for the night. She stayed in the ICU and had awesome care by nurses Cynthia and Adrian. They are phenomenal women and nurses. Our daughter ended up being the very last ICU patient discharged and the last pediatric patient to be admitted in the old hospital. The day she was discharged on the grand opening day of the new Zuckerberg hospital wing. We have Kaiser &amp; have been through their emergency room several times. We have never received the level of care at Kaiser that we received at SF General.

Kayden Glass,"I had an emergency, ended up at SFGH. Pretty routine emergency room visit.Bill was over $18,000 for what any other emergency room would have charge $1500.My insurance ends up paying the $18,000. I get 3 bills saying I owe $0, and then suddenly I get a letter from a collection agency saying I owe another $434. Called SFGH 3 times and never reached anyone, just VM. Took them 2 weeks to call me back. After another 5 phone calls, I 3-wayed them with my insurance and it turns out they are using the wrong codes for billing. Instead of apologizing, they escalate it with the collection agency who now starts to harass me. Didn't want to damage my credit, so just went ahead and paid the collection agency the $434.A week later, I get another bill from $434. Time to contact an attorney and ask them to help me resolve the situation. I'd rather pay a competent attorney $5k, then give these incompetent thieves another $434.I don't understand how an organization so incompetent is allowed to manage billing for a major hospital and doctor's group.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Louie Brookes,"Ended up at the ER after a bike accident. The resident was nice and did a good job.. My issues stem from the incompetent clowns that run the payment department, from the supervisor level down to the bitter woman with the charisma of The Grinch crossed with Mr. Scrooge. Feel free to call them during business hours to pay your bill, they won't pick up. Feel free to leave a message telling them that you want to pay, they may call back in three days at a really inconvenient hour while you are at work. Good luck finding a person to complain to, as their patient's advocate doesn't keep her voice mail empty. Good luck having them actually receive your mail with payment information provided, since that seems to conveniently get lost in the dark abyss known as ""The Payment Department"". If somehow you had no choice but to go to this hospital (as was the case with me), hope that they don't screw up your bill from the get -go (I apparently owed $0 for about 3 months), and then have them send letters to your door saying that you are delinquent soon after. SF General. Step your game up. In the 21st century, we have email, we have accounting departments that actually pick up their phones. Maybe asking for online payment is too much, but at the very least, be more responsive when you have someone who is actually trying to pay their bill.As for the average Joe or Jane, if you can choose to go to the ER, don't go here unless you want to be trapped in a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare of being shuttled around to the voice mail of different people in different departments, only to never hear back once you leave the hospital. If you can't. Good luck to you.P.S.The one star is because the operators on their mainline are awesome. They actually listen and try to help out.

She ask if thought maybe it was my allergies since I have seasonal allergies which I say no because when I do have allergies I have itchy eyes as well, then she say I'm not asking you details i was asking you a yes or no question?. She should it say from the beginning I'm going to ask you a few questions just say yes or no? But no she was extremely rude and did not help at all. It's been two weeks since I'm sick and last week when I called the nurse I spoke to say it was a cold and that I should let my body fight it but since it's been too long and I'm not getting better plus my baby has a cold too.

Â The trauma center is primary filled with homeless, addicts and mentally ill getting free treatment. Â I went in with a broken and severally lacerated big toe. At the very least they were nice enough to give me a private room right off the the hallway filled with homeless on cots, but then left me unattended for over ONE HOUR with no pain medication while i was in severe pain. After several complaints, I finally hobbled out and told them I'm leaving and they rushed and gave me a pain pill and a script i could fill. Â Not to mention I hear their rates are exorbitant to pay for all the free treatments. Â $5 aspirin anyone? It's great that this place exists for the uninsured but remember - nothing is free, the treatments are on the taxpayers back.

No one shares notes in this place ? It took 14 hrs of laying in a gurney to get any water or food or proper pain medication.

Finley Fraser,"I'm writing on the behalf of my boyfriend whose experience has been unpleasant.Sure, they were able to perform the surgery he needed, and gave the pain medication they needed but the medical staff, practitioners and nurses NEED a lesson on how to treat their patients NICELY, WITH RESPECT.The following are the names of some fellows working who you need to watch out for:- Giselle, a Latino woman working as an assistant nurse working at 4D, DOES NOT know how to handle patients with sensitivity in touch- old lady in registration in room 3M has a lot of unresolved negative attitude, and sometimes she would blast her loud classical musical. The workers in the other window say the woman has been working in the hospital for years and that they have no control on how she performs her job- orthopedic Dr. Kandemir: super curt, short tempered, impatient and a dick. Not very caring towards his patients. Even bailed out for one of the appointments he was scheduled for to see my boyfriend.Now the argument for why some might say these low performances are acceptable since SF General Hospital is a public hospital and that they treat everyone THAT DOES NOT GIVE THEM ANY RIGHT TO ACT LIKE DICKWADS.Anyone who want to pursue a career in medical industry cannot just get into the industry because it pays a lot of bank. They actually have to be compassionate and sympathetic towards people.If I get sued for libel for posting openly on yelp (especially by someone loaded with money, ahem, the orthopedic) well that will absolutely prove my point that their attitudes are no doubt unacceptable. For yelpers reading my comment, I wish that you will be inspired to comment and review health practitioners because then we could share our experiences, compare which health care is the best and seek transparency. We have the right to do so because we pay for this expensive shit.

I have been a patient in other circumstances that landed me in a couple different wards. They did their jobs and were nice people by and large - no complaints.I really wanted to offer my gratitude to the woman who directs the traffic at the construction entrance - I walked past her everyday for two months going through a lot of painful stuff and I was horribly depressed. She always got me to smile by doing a little dance and flashing her grin &amp; would say nearly singing-ly ""heya heya!"" - her kindness and awesome attitude helped me a lot and I hope I see her soon to thank her.

Â There were patients that looked like they were about to die from drug overdose waiting in the hallways and after getting an x-ray, they left my hospital bed directly facing a guy whose face was gushing blood everywhere. When I saw the police in the hall ways, it kind of explained it all; this hospital seems to be primarily for homeless people and or gang members.

After getting dismissed, I started feeling dizzy and couldn't see so my friend took me straight to UCSF where they were absolutely shocked I hadn't had a CT Scan. UCSF is like heaven comparatively.

Â When we were finally called in, I was seen by a Nurse Practitioner, who was friendly enough, but not entirely competent, and he spoke with me for less than one minute before writing me an Rx for some antibiotics and sending me on my way.You can understand my surprise, then, when the Explanation of Benefits arrived in the mail from my expensive PPO plan, indicating that the facility (SF General) was covered but not the provider (the Nurse Practitioner). Â This stuck me with a bill for $500.I called the hospital and told them that I was going to appeal the insurance company's decision, on the grounds that it didn't adhere to any form of logic. Â I asked them to HOLD OFF ON ANY FURTHER BILLS UNTIL I CONTACT THEM WITH THE RESULTS OF MY APPEAL, WHICH COULD TAKE ABOUT 6 WEEKS. Â They said, ""Sure thing.""Well, six weeks later, the insurance company approved my appeal and paid the ""standard allowed amount"" for the charges.

Cairo Kearns,"First of all, let me say I'm definately blessed to be here! Â So onto the review. Â I was in a major car wreck only a week and a half ago. Â The fact that I'm typing on the computer is a testament to my good health and blessings. Â So after I hit the bullet ridden camero that was abandoned on the 101 in the slow lane, the paramedics took me to SFGH ER. Â Props to the paramedics who made it a funny ride. Â THey strapped me into the guerney with spike high heels, shiny clutch purse and all. Â They were pretty cute to, through my just hit with air bags, wrecked my car, eyes. Â I asked them why, when they rolled me in, there was a SF Sheriff station. Â They said ""Alot of stuff goes down in here"". Â Great, I thought. Â This is gonna be a fun experience. Â They put me in the aisle between an old man sleeping with his ass hanging out, making intermittant farting and snoring noises, and a homeless dude screaming for pain meds. (This dude kept screaming for someone to give him his fake leg so he could use the bathroom. Â No one helped him- and he ended up deficating on himself. Â Now thats F$% up!)The admission guy asked me if I was insured. Â Yes, through Kaiser. Â He proceeded to CALL KAISER to see if I was insured. Â What was the point of that!?

Â So- a week and a half later, I have all my bodily functions so I'm pretty sure my spine is not gravely injured. Â But come on! Â An x-ray or Cat scan is a totally appropriate test for someone who just hit an abandoned car in the middle of the freeway! Â I truely feel they didn't test further because they knew Kasier wouldn't pay them for those tests. Â My rant has more to do with the state of health care today than with SFGH, but still- SFGH has the charge of providing quality health care. Â I was totally in shock, and I think my fight or flight response was in full gear, so they shipped me out at 3 in the morning- high heels and all- and I took a cab home. Â So-did I get quality care? Not really. Â Is it cause SFGH is an inadequete medical institution? Not really.

Carson Christensen,"I have three experiences with this hospital. Â All vary in star rating.:-One morning, not so long a go (May,) I thought I was having a heart attack. Â I decided to go to the hospital. Â They were very nice to me at SFGHMC and informed me that I was actually having an ANXIETY attack. Â They gave me drugs and sent me home and didn't even charge me for the visit. Â Nor did I have to wait. Â That was a five star experiance: informed medical staff informs patient she is not dying, gives her happy pills and doesn't charge.-In 2004 I was in a play. Â In the play I didn't wear shoes. Â One night a thoughtless dude stepped on the instep of my foot backstage and basically crushed my poor little footie. Â It hurt and I couldn't walk after the shock wore off - my boyfriend at the time insisted we go to the ER - because I don't have insurance we went to General. Â I had to wait forever, the doctors manhandled my poor, injured foot and didn't even give me painkillers to dull the pain.

Â Very, very, very sick. Â Sick enough to think I might be dying.I call Yellow Cab (who comes faster at 4am than they do at 4pm, go figure) and have them take me to General. Â The waiting room is packed. Â When I was signing in at triage the individual I was talking to asked me why I was coming into the ER (you mean that my pale, sweaty, shaking self doesn't give you a clue? Â I'M SICK LADY.) Â I quietly - in between hacking up a lung every third word - gave her my symptoms and she said: ""You have the flu, you'd be better off going home and just sleeping.""Um. Â Okay - I *might* have the flu; but, I also have a *fever of 103.2 and I know (from my Mom scaring the shit out of me about it for years and years) that high fevers like that in adults are deadly... Â so, um, yeah I'd like to see a doctor, thanks!I tell her this and she ROLLS HER EYES AT ME.I sat down, angry - pulled out my book and pretended to read - couldn't focus on that due to feeling like I was on fire with anger and fever... pulled out my iPod and tried to listen to that... couldn't concentrate on Joey Ramone singing about chicken vindeloo because I was too angry and nauseous. Â Pulled out my earpods, huffed and puffed in discomfort and anger for a few minutes; and, then called Yellow Cab and came home.One star experiance. Â Totes one star. Â Actually, now that I think about it: NEGATIVE one star... because I spent about $40 on cabs roundtrip and didn't even get seen by a doctor or made to feel better in any way-shape-or-form.Meh.Average it out and I'd say General gets three stars.Sadly there is not much of a choice for the broke and uninsured in this city beyond them. *Note: high fevers make you hallucinate scarier shit than any drug I've ever tried. Â 'Scuse me now I have to go take a bath in ice water. Â Ugh.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Immediately after got X-ray done by really cute and nice x-ray specialist Then 6 people, Â involved in shooting were dropped off by ambulance...After just of 2 hours waiting doctor were able to look at my results and calmed me down that I am fine.Overall experience: incredible care, attentive people and waiting is just a part of ER.

Phoenix Ramsey,"Copied from my blog. Â I am new to town and poor, so I went to the 4th floor drop-in clinic for poor people.-----------------------I rarely have good health care experiences, so i avoid them unless it's important, this was one of the worst.My hearing half went in my left ear. I know why, it happened in the spring- just impacted stuff, maybe the fault of using earplugs to sleep. Fix it with a plain little irrigation. It's not a big deal but it's so annoying I wanted it done immediately. Â (Would you be happy about being half deaf?)No insurance = I thought ""hmm the hospital is the closest place with drop-in service"" so I went there.After 3 hrs. I thought ""this is absolutely ridiculous but I'm way up in line so might as well not leave.""I got kinda ill from having no food that day so I got some snacks, but just felt worse, and figured out it was because I had no coffee either. I bugged the desk people for an aspirin and they refused.Another hour went by and I was just about falling over from a splitting headache and they still couldn't help. They stuck me in a room and said someone would be right there.Another hour went by and someone finally showed up, by then I was immobile with pain, on the verge of puking. The person prescribed eardrops and wouldn't do an irrigation, told me to come back after using the drops. WTF? Â I got one right away last time I went looking for one, it did the job, and it's a 1-minute procedure using water and the simplest squirty tool. Â 5 hrs. wait for nothing, and I left with 2 problems instead of 1.Better now, I limped home and ate some advil.Arrgh, San Fran general is the worst. To be fair, they must have bumped me way down in priority (just for an ear thing) and the person who saw me was friendly. Â Filthy bathroom and waiting room, though... homeless people left trash all over. Â I will check out some of the numerous neighborhood clinics instead. Â And they say San Fran has one of the best safety nets of anywhere... at least there's a city plan to pay something for uninsured people.UPDATE Â At the drug store, I looked for something that might help my messed up ears. Yes, they sell a home ear-igation kit. For $8 I solved the problem that doctor wouldn't fix. Â From the experience, it sure did need a treatment, not any old q-tips. Â Ears are fixed now and it's like I was walking around with bad eyesight and got new glasses. Â I know what old people feel like and it sucks. Â Don't treat your ears badly, put some earplugs in if you go to a rock show. Â And don't go to SF Gen for routine things (though, I hear they're wonderful if you get your balls shot off or something drastic.)",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Kiki Woods,"I have been here twice for motorcycle accidents and it is far from a pleasant experience. Â First, it is unbelievably expensive - if you do not have insurance then do not go here unless you are practically dead.Both my accidents were pretty minor so I have never actually been treated, just evaluated -x-rays and that sort of thing. Â Not even a prescription. Â Both bills, including ambulance, ER, x-rays and total came out to the $10,000 range. Â That is correct, no treatment, just evaluation $10,000 per visit.Additionally, they make it an all day affair and expect to lay in a bed in the HALL for at least several hours waiting to be released. Â When I was in the ER there were about 14 workers running around like chickens with their heads cut off - bullshitting with each other and pretty much ignoring the patient. Â I was asked the same series of questions about 8 times by 8 people. Â It seems like they are really jaded.Finally, good luck trying to get your bill or any sort of medical records. Â Expect to be on hold at least 30 minutes if you call needing any record - everyone is too busy.If you are in an accident at the very least just take a cab and save yourself $6,000 for the ambulance.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Corey Searle,"This review is for SFGH Dermatology: Â  Â Many wonderful people begin their teaching, nursing, or MD professions filled with ambition and hope; ready to change the world. Unfortunately, these types of public service positions can be very taxing on one's soul and before long many of these same bright eyed hopefuls become jaded and stagnant. Inspiring lectures become monotonous instructions and earnest guidance becomes standard prescription. General Hospital and the health care system in general have an even more difficult task given the higher rate of mentally challenged and drug addicted patients they encounter day after day. These doctors and nurses treat many of the same faces for the same issues time and time again yet they persevere because they understand that they are some of the most needed people on the planet. I can only imagine that with every wasted word of advice and rotation of that revolving door, a doctor's heartstrings must pull a bit tighter until eventually they snap... Â  Â  Well I'm glad to say that some souls refuse to break. I had been struggling with a very serious illness for more than two months and my various experiences with different doctors had left me feeling defeated and desperate. Although unemployed and uninsured at the time, I was scheduled to begin substitute teaching in autumn. Unfortunately, the onset of my sickness left me bed ridden, weak, and unable to begin work. Despite my current financial status and lack of insurance, I needed a doctor who would commit to finding the source of my sickness. I needed someone that would truly care. Â  Â  This is why I feel so fortunate to have met Dr. Misha Mutizwa and his exceptional team. The Dermatology Unit at SFGH is incredibly busy and their schedule was booked for the entire month but when Dr. Mutizwa heard about the severity of my condition he insisted on seeing me immediately. The first person I met in his department was Dr. Davina Wu, with one look she knew that I was in a fragile state. She saw the fear in my eyes and assured me that they would stand by me until we discovered the nature and cause of my perplexing illness. She asked an assortment of succinct questions and upon examination of my condition she was unflinching and extremely compassionate. After performing her evaluation, she briefly left the room and returned with Dr. Misha Mutizwa. My initial impression of him was very encouraging. His strong presence and reassuring demeanor brought a sense of hope into the room. For the first time in two months, I was convinced I would be ok. Dr. Mutizwa immediately recognized the seriousness of my situation and assured me that he was going to be with me every step of the way. This was something we would get through together. He gave me the support I needed and his unwavering voice (He makes Shadoe Stevens sound like Gilbert Gottfried) had my girlfriend in tears. Â  Â  I really can't stress enough how sincerely dedicated these doctors are. They had an entire team in the room within minutes. Despite it being close to closing time, they called several different departments and pulled every string necessary to get me the testing I needed. In less than an hour I had numerous biopsies, blood tests, and different cultures performed to finally get some answers. This man was a saint. He went above and beyond to ensure that I got the necessary prescriptions from the hospital pharmacy and made sure I did so in the most cost efficient way possible. And it doesn't stop there. The very same night we left the hospital Dr. Misha Mutizwa called my girlfriend on his drive home from work because he had thought of some ideas for foods that I might be able to swallow since he was concerned about my weight loss and inability to eat. Then, a few hours later he called again! I have difficulty taking painkillers so he had suggested a new brand for me to try and was calling to see how I was reacting to the medication. My eyes are literally tearing up as I write this. I picture Misha sitting in his living room unable to relax because he was worried about me. Up until that afternoon I was just another face in the crowd but since our meeting, Dr. Mutizwa has called everyday to make sure I am doing better and I have never felt more blessed. Â  Â  I am happy to say that I am on my way to a rapid recovery and feeling more optimistic than ever. Dr. Mutizwa and Dr. Wu are a dynamic team. Their perfect blend of empathy and strength gave me the will to push through one of the most difficult periods of my life. The genuine devotion that these doctors displayed is something that cannot be faked. They were born to help those in need and I wish there were more words to express the gratitude I feel towards them and the rest of the amazing staff at SFGH. Thank you all so so much...",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Rory Mckinney,"So when I got the bill for the non-existent service (see the previous review), it's was $700 and I about fell on my ass. I was Ã¼ber-pissed.Yesterday I visited the billing department, ready for some negotiation and poised for a huge fight. Fortunately, I had enrolled in the Healthy San Francisco Health Access program a couple of days following my trip to Urgent Care. I spoke with Amanda in the financial counseling department, who...get this... actually listened and sympathized with me. How often does that happen? She was able to reduce the cost of service to $45 and gave me the option of disputing the charges further by referring me to a patient advocate, which was more trouble than it was worth. I never had to get crazy! While I will never return to Urgent Care at SFGH, and I am pleased to see the problem is probably department specific. The people in billing were great.For those of you who don't have health insurance, it is essential that you look into Healthy San Francisco. If you are an SF resident, there are two ways to enroll. You can either pay a modest monthly fee or have your employer contribute to the fund, which waives the cost to you altogether (any good employer should take care of their people). Â It's an unprecedented program and I'm thrilled to live in a city that offers such a service.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Amara Burns,"Before anyone gets mad, I do applaud the ER/Trauma units for their medical care.My 1-star is for the fact that even after that poor woman was allowed to be left in the stairwell to die, they have not implemented any measures to keep track of their patients.My dear friend went to SF General last year after a fall in which she sustained a neck fracture. Â I spoke to the ER nurse who was very helpful, and informative. Â I was told that my friend would be admitted to the hospital that afternoon. Â When I called the main number, they had no record of my friend in their system. Â I thought the worst, that she hadn't survived the ER. Â After many back and forth calls, I finally spoke to an ER nurse who looked into where my friend had gone, and she was alive and fairly well in their hospital!Early this morning, 3am, my friend was taken to SF General, I didn't know why. Â When I got the message in the morning, I called and spoke to the Eligibility worker who needed to know her secondary insurance. Â I gave her the information and asked if she knew what had happened, and she said that it was listed as a fall at home. Â She said that my friend was being admitted to the hospital, but as there were no rooms available, she was still in the ER. Â At around 11:30am a nurse called and I was able to speak to my friend, still in the ER. Â She said that she'd call as soon as they put her in a room. Â A couple of hours later, I got a call from a doctor at SF General who explained what had been done, and would be done. Â He said that my friend would be kept overnight for observation adn IV fluids, and most likely released tomorrow. Â At around 5:30pm she left me a voicemail (I was walking her dog), stating that she had a room- Ward A, Room 4. Â When I called, I was told that there was no such room, and that they had NO RECORD of my friend in the hospital. Â I was transferred to Unit 4A- they repeated the same story of no record of my friend, could she have a different last name, was I sure she was taken to SF General...I explained everything, and they said she might be in 4D because that's where the Trauma patients go. Â Same thing happened when I spoke to Unit 4D. Â I repeated my story, and was transferred to the ER unit. Â THEY HAD NO RECORD OF MY FRIEND IN THE COMPUTER!!!!! Â Finally, the nurse said she'd look in her ""book,"" and came back telling me that my friend was initially registered as ""Trauma Uniform"" because she came via ambulance and that code expedites treatment. Â She said my friend was in Unit 5A, and would transfer me, but if I called back to ask for ""Uniform.""HUH?!?!?!? Â After finally speaking to my friend, she explained that her wallet was missing so she didn't have her drivers license with her...but since she had previously been a patient, they had a copy of her expired drivers license on file...this wasn't good enough for them to put her into the hospital computer under her given name!!!!!! Â i just faxed over a copy of her California ID. Â This is inexcusable. Â If someone goes into a hospital, and gives you her name, social security #...why would you not input that information into the computer registration system? Â Obviously they inputted it into the billing system because they called me to find out who besides Medicare they could get money from.This is unacceptable business practice, and puts undue stress on the family/friends who are trying to locate their loved ones.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jaime Wallace,"I had a rash on my chest that I tried to cure by myself with Neosporin. Â It didn't work and so I changed it to antifungal powder. Â It got worse and it became severe. Â Also I developed a fever. Â I called St. Anthony's on call doctor and left a message. Â No one called me back. Â That was on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday I called the Haight clinic. Â They referred me to the Mission clinic and scheduled a same day appt.. Â When I arrived, they said I that I didn't have an appt. there. Â I called the Haight clinic several times but they were not answering their phone. Â The Mission clinic referred me to a different clinic near 17th and Sanchez, and when I got there it was closed. Â They're not open on Thursdays. Â I called several clinics and kept getting turned away. Â Each receptionist I spoke to told me that her clinic is not accepting new patients, and they all referred me to a different clinic. Â I would call the ones they suggested, and those clinics were not accepting new patients either.Finally someone told me to visit the Urgent care dept. at the main hospital. Â On Friday I arrived at 10:30 am, and I asked the receptionist if I need to fill out eligibility forms for Healthy San Francisco before being seen. Â She told me to ask the nurse. Â I took a number and waited to be called. Â The nurse did a 5 minute triage, and then I returned to the waiting room.The receptionist said that my wait would be about an hour, and so I asked if I should fill out my eligibility forms. Â She said yes, and gave me instructions on what building and office to go to. Â She sent me to the wrong building, but after I finally found the right place, the eligibility receptionist told me their office was closed for lunch, and to return in an hour. Â I expected to be in an examining room then, and I would have to wait until after being examined by the doctor to return. Â I returned to the urgent care dept. At 2:30 pm, which was 4 hours after my arrival, I was finally taken to an examination room. Â A nurse practitioner came to see me sometime between 2:30 and 3 pm. Â She suspected that my rash was fungus and that I might have diabetes, and so someone else came and tested my blood sugar. Â It turned out to be perfect, and so the nurse prescribed anti fungal cream at the in house pharmacy.I took my prescription to the pharmacy, and they told me to pick it up in 3 days. Â Today is Friday, and they told me to pick it up on Monday. Â I insisted that I need it right away, and so they said to come back at 7:30 pm. Â In brief, it takes new patients 3 days to be seen for a severe rash and fever. Â Once they get accepted somewhere, it takes from 10:30 am until 7:30 to be examined and given a tube of antifungal cream.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Ever since I feel very dizzy even when I laid down on the bed and fell a lot's pain on my head.After that we received there bill's, which we did paid for and one of the bill was a duplicate bill, Â the first bill was paid by credit card on 9/24/11 and later they send another bill siding that the credit card did not go thought , but actually did went thought , so my husband send them out a check again for the same amount on 10/24/11.The billing dept. knew this was a duplicated payment and keep QUITE.

Cory Waller,"had to get my ear cleaned yesterday because of a wax buildup from using earplugs (nasty, i know). So here I go to the Emergency Care on building 80 after phoning in on Friday night. The lady on the phone was a bit rushed and rude, but cool enough knowing that this is a free hospital afer all and I'm sure they get a lot of stupid and crazy phonecalls. So I get there at 8 am like they told me to. I was one of the few people there, to my surprise since my roommate and everyone I know told me I'd have to wait for hours on end just to see someone. I take a number and sit down to wait for my patient registration/intake, the cutest Chinese nurse was there working her butt off with a smile. Everyone in the waiting room was a nutcase or a weirdo or a crack addict, so it must have been a nice break for them to get a (sorry if i toot my own horn here) ""regular"" guy who had showered before coming in and whatnot. The doctors and nurses here are miracle workers. And this is the main point of my review. This hospital operates under really dire and budget-stricken conditions that force the employees to make-do with what they have, while keeping an optimistic attitude. Everyone was super nice and had a bit of humor sense (you have to have one if you work at this hospital with this kind of clients!). But the truth is that this is a hospital with fully capable employees that are just as trained and capable as the private hospital ones, if not more since they see a lot of crazy stuff and have to deal with a lack of resources (see uber-talented Cuban doctors for reference of what i'm talking about). Â My doctor brought the nurse in to see the procedure he was going to conduct on me (ear cleansing/flushing) and he was very helpful with her letting her look inside my ear and really understand what he was about to do. Doctors are working their butt off and training nurses are learning quite a lot! This hospital deserves a lot more credit than it gets, and double the amount of funding.

Cheyenne Neale,"This place is why SF is the bestest city on earth. They take care of everyone, from uninsured artists and college students to weathly trauma victims to that crazy guy that sits on the end of your block and smells like pee. That their commitment to UNIVERSAL health care, one that isn't shared by the majority of this country. Not only that but every doc there is affiliated with UCSF, one of the most prestigious medical centers in the US. Yes SFGH has its issues (it is as real as it gets) but it serves people no one else will see on a sliding scale. Including you. To those who whine about long ER waits I say this - Get over yourself! Being 15-35 and having a fever/body aches/cough is NOT a life threatening emergency! Having a bleeding wound is not (necessarily) a life threating emergency, trust me the bleeding will likely stop on its own and you'll get stitches in a few hours.You should be prepared to wait Â (HOURS) behind the 50-90 year olds who can't breathe, are actively having a heart attack or the gunshot victims who roll through. Â If you don't like the smell or over worked staff consider the alternative - no care. Thats what most uninsured people have outside of this fine city.

Nevaeh Harris,"For a diverse and progressive community as San Francisco, SFGH is one of the worst care facilities I've experienced treatment at during the 25+ years I lived and worked in the city. To avoid any liability problems in detailing the specifics of what I experienced there and why, I'll avoid going into the genuine trauma I endured at a facility particularly set up for assisting in the healing of those enduring the side effects of medical/physical/domestic and social needs being either unmet or worsened as a result of the hospital's inability to properly attend the overload of patients and their needs ~ notably those without coverage, representation, friends, family or other Medical Professionals so as to provide essential personal and appropriate care, as well as, a staff comprised of clinicians, CNAs, RNs and MDs that are unable, unwilling, or otherwise prevented from securing the safety of their patients, communicating directly with those requiring their assistance (rather than defaulting to agencies and other professionals without access to nor education regarding the circumstances of the patient,) to make the best effort to administer the most befitting care. Regardless of the fact that the hospital - especially its more generalized departments - will almost always allow for care without the need for any insurance (even for Specialized treatment,) my experience (even during visits wherein I had Specialized PPO or similar coverage,) proved indifferent at best and pernicious at worst. I've experienced medical professionals assaulting patients, watched a clear recognition of a pattern of abuse via law enforcement, domestic partners and others by way of false allegations which, though proven untrue and thus bestowing establishing evidence in contrast with the type of abuse nearly always present within the facility, no action - to improve, modify, or set guidelines to prevent such circumstance from continuing - were ever put into action in the 20+ years I lived in San Francisco. At present, my personal experiences at SFGH's multiple departments include, but are not limited to: 1.) being involuntarily held against my will for over 72 hours, receiving involuntary ECT yet ultimately being released without any treatment - due to the fact that my Medical Representative, who was recognized by several MDs and RNs at the hospital as a cause for severe trauma va false information he knowingly supplied the clinicians there with incorrect information and/or generating malevolent conduct, direct impairment or incorrect diagnoses - any/all which lead to intensive and harmful damaging periods in my otherwise normal life,",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jaskaran Archer,"Well, since writing that review last June, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and spent four days at Â SFGH to have my thyroid gland and a bunch of lymph nodes removed (seven hours of surgery).. Â I got the best medical and nursing care I've ever Â had. Â Since my surgery, I've been cared for by the endocrinology clinic at General and it's been terrific. Â I see a UCSF endocrinologist every month, get blood drawn frequently and get my prescriptions filled all at General. Â SFGH is a great hospital, operating under terrific budgetary constraints. Â They are challenged every day to take care of of those of us who are poor, sick and abandoned by the health insurance industry, and they do it with kindness and class. Â They figure out what is wrong with us, they stitch up our wounds and they put up with a whole lot. Â We are so lucky to have SFGH and everyone who works there!",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Loren Griffith,"I ate at the Cafeteria the other day and I was pretty impressed. Â The food is by no means gourmet, but very well done and at affordable prices. Â I had a bacon cheese burger with a side of onion rings and it was pretty tasty. Â The patty's are partially pre-cooked and finished on a grill. Â It had a nice char to it and overall nice flavor. Â The onion rings are from a frozen bag but the portion is huge..even for a side... and had a nice crunch. Â All of this for about $7 with a drink. Â I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you are spending a lot of time here as I have been lately... It isn't a bad place to have a lunch or dinner here.",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Taran Frye,"Well, after spending 8 hours here the other day only to walk out no more clear on my medical situation than I was when I hobbled in, I'm of mixed feelings. The staff here are incredible, particularly in the ER. They put up with some unbelievable cases and people, and do it with a smile and a gentle touch. Like the woman who was a shamed alcoholic when she came in, ready to readdress her life and stop drinking a pint an a half of vodka a day, but later turned sour and enraged - possibly, probably, when the vodka she'd had that morning wore off - and walked out Against Medical Advice rather than wait another 15 minutes for test results.The thing is, I know the staff deal with a lot of shit because I was there for 8 hours, and had plenty of time to watch the sideshow. And boy, did I wish I had remembered that I'm now an insured individual and don't really need to go there before I went, cause I'd have at least those 8 hours back. And that' why I give three stars - I can't really recommend you go there if you have any other available option, but I'm thankful as hell that you can go if you don't.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jaydan Lyons,"I've had two friends who had to stay at SF General during the past year. My visits to them were nothing short of shocking. One friends is currently dying in 5A, and he told me staying there is ""torture."" The nurses and people ""caring"" for him are rude and rough when they change his bedding. Where is the compassion? They did let me stay after hours one night, which was nice, but at 9:15 at night, his ""room-mate"" had the television on loud, a nurse had a flat-panel computer seven feet away and talking with another staff member about the computer system and its problems out loud, without any consideration that my friend is desperately trying to get some sleep. This place is something out of a nightmare. I appreciate the fact that it serves low-income folks, but how they serve them matters.....Update: Well, the I stopped by last night. The obnovious roommate is gone, replaced by an old man. Guess what, he's tied to his hospital bed! What a nightmare. I tried to ask the orderly stationed there about the condition of my friend, but he barely spoke English, so I had to find his nurse on my own.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Brook Dunn,"The worst hospital I have ever been to. I was seen for a crushed hand. I got checked in at 1120 am. My fingers were busted open bleeding. My skin was hanging off. They did not clean the blood or the gashes until 5pm. They just let me sit there bleeding. Through out the whole time there, the nurses and doctors came into my room looking for patients they had lost at least 8 times. As I was getting all the gashes stitched up, the orthopedic who was working on my hand told me I would've out of work for 6-8 weeks. After I was done getting stitched up and getting the cast on. It took another hour in a half for anyone to come see me. Finally I got my release papers with out seeing the doctor again. I was given nothing for pain or swelling. Also didn't receive anything about work. It was by far the worst treatment I've ever received.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Charly Rudd,"This place is awesome. Â I've been to many General Hospital throughout the years, and when you're in pain, it's good to have caring and efficient people nearby. Â I've been to places where they make particular comments to me (asking if I understand English for one, after I just retell the doctor what my symptoms are in perfect English), to having disorganized workers, being looked down upon/judged/disbelieved...as well as random General Hospital that are unkempt, with an indifferent/superior/I'm too tired for this BS vibe. Â Yet, we are all human and seemingly underpaid and underappreciated, but maybe that's why this hospital experience stood out so much to me.This place is different. It is the only city hospital and yet, they were quick and responsive in the ER, versus making you wait for hours. Â I also know that in the cases of sexual assault, you can go in directly and not have to wait, and you have the option of having a victim/survivor advocate with you, which is super helpful to have (since you'll be questioned by several people once you enter). SFWAR helps with this, so join us in the 5K walk against rape on sat, april 25th btw!The workers collaborated really well, everyone knew what they were doing and the relationships shared amongst them seemed open and friendly.

Arianne Aguirre,"I was having unusual leg pain on New Year's Eve and hesitatingly went to the Urgent Care center at SFGH - I thought of trekking to UCSF, but knew I'd be spending a good chunk of time waiting and didn't want to lengthen the trip with a long commute on the bus. And SFGH is only two blocks from my house.Needlesstosay, I was very cautious about going here, but I must say I had a positive experience. I was in and out in three hours - longer than ideal, but much shorter than expected - and dealt with a very pleasant staff, despite it being a holiday, a couple crazies wandering about and several language barriers to deal with. There was obvious frustration in the faces of a couple nurses and in conversations I overheard, which I winced at because the last thing I wanted when it was my turn was bad service or bad attitudes (a lot to ask for at a public hospital, I know).The most negative aspect of my experience was...well, the other patients. They talked so loud amongst themselves, with no regard to those around them, that I didn't even hear the nurse call out my name at first. Once treatment finally began, I couldn't have asked for a friendlier bunch, full of smiles and laughs. Their bedside manner was great - especially when I ran into one of the nurses at a local lunch spot after I left. When she saw me, she got up from her table to come ask me what the assessment was, explained my diagnosis further, and offered me her suggestions for follow up with my own doctor. If only all doctors/nurses showed so much concern - my only regret is not getting her name so I could review or follow up with her!",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Lexi Wharton,"On Sunday, Nov. 14th, I was hit by a car while crossing Market street. I went to the ER, obviously, and was in a lot of pain and scared out of my mind. Customer service was the last thing from my mind.The fact that the doctors and nurses were very proffesional and knew their jobs didn't surprise me. But I was shocked at how nice everyone was. I talked them out of cutting my jeans off (my favorite pair!) and they very gently worked them off. They told me everything they were doing (""this is an ultrasound, it will be a little cold,"" ""these are for the EKG,"" etc.) and made sure I understood and was okay with everything. They were concerned about injuries to my pelvis, and needed to take my underpants off, and made a point to keep me covered. Small things I suppose, but it added up to mean a lot. Everyone, from the head doctor to the nurses to the administration guy, was friendly and helpful. They helped me file a police report (it was a hit and run) and although I declined pain medication for a while becasue I don't have insurance, they talked me into it when it was obvious I needed it. It was a wise choice.Once they knew I didn't have any life-threatening injuries, I kind of expected them to ignore me and discharge me. But they made sure I was comfortable (as comfortable as I could be,) and one nurse who's name I regretably forget kinda stayed with me, wheeled me out to a waiting car and made sure I was taken care of. To be fair, it was a slow night, but still, the genuineness was there.On a lighter note, I had never been to the ER before. Are all Emergency Rooms filled with doctors and nurses this attractive, male and female alike? I always thought the tv show ER was ridiculous because everyone was so hot, but this staff makes that show look like the cast of the muppets. Oh, and the police report? Why the hell do I have to wait 2 hours for Â an officer to arrive when there were no less than 5 cops standing around doing nothing? That is a yelp for another day, and it won't be nearly as positive.",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Robbie Hagan,"I would give this evil place a 0 rating if it were possible; alas, my I must give it star. Even one star gives me pain. I just want people to know they must never go to the Adult Urgent Care center here *ever*.I had a cold for a week, with a massive cold sore outbreak, and I was coughing up green phlegm. I couldn't sleep at night, I had bad headaches, I couldn't breathe from congestion. I was in hell, and I didn't know where to get medical attention in this new city.In short, I spent 6.5 hours sitting next to crackheads who were beaten by strangers and leather-pant-clad drunken dykes. I was miserable. My reward for my superhuman patience was a 6.5 minute analysis by a nurse, who told me to take Robitussin, and nothing was wrong with me at all.This was a dramatic, egregious farce. I was livid, but in too much pain to do anything. But hey, I didn't pay anything up front! Welcome to public shit medicine in the USA.I later went to a real doctor recommended by a friend. It turns out I had really bad bronchitis, and I needed an antibiotic, as well as a nasal steroid so I could breathe. I was so mistreated by these vermin at San Francisco General Hospital, that I wish nobody the horrible pain I suffered.

Miller Bailey,"I was brought to SF General Hospital this morning by ambulance and was seen right away. The doctors, nurses and x-ray technician who helped me out were all so cool and friendly. It really restored my faith in humanity after I got hit on my bike. See, the guy who hit me got out of his car and accused me of being at fault saying that I ran the red light. He didnt even ask if I was ok. When when my witness came over and said that we DID have the green, he took off before the cops showed up. Its ok. I got his licence plate number.

Ashleigh Stein,"I had a wonderful encounter when I broke my foot while on the job and had to visit the ER. Matter of fact, I believe the physician who treated me even sent a get-well message here. She was fantastic and so were all of the staff I encountered that night. Now? I won't go back unless my life literally depends on it. An orthopedist referred me to the 4M clinic for a neurology visit due to migraines that were exacerbating my foot. I waited a couple of months for any word that I'd get to see a neurologist, only to receive a letter in April telling me I'd missed an appointment. So I missed an appointment I never knew I had. Okay, busy staff, whatever, I called, got an appointment for two months later. That neurologist was useless. She was polite, yes, but at the end of the day if you're telling a patient with a history of migraines to just, you know, get over it while you take this preventative antidepressant even when you're in actual tears because you've had a crippling migraine for days, maybe reevaluate your job. I asked for the most basic of care, a common non-narcotic migraine treatment that has been proven to work. It's called Imitrex! It's sumatriptan! I can't sell it, get high, or get whacked out of my skull from a TRIPTAN. Are you kidding me? She told me to take the preventative and to come back in two months. In tears I left, yes, with a preventative prescription, but when I tried to schedule a new appointment in two months, I was told a letter would be sent. And yes, I high-tailed it over to the ER to get my migraine treated so I could start the preventative medication I was given. They gave me decent care and understood I was in pain. That was it. I have to make this short or I'll get an aneurysm but basically whoever prescribed the meds at Walgreen's were given incorrect instructions that didn't match what the doctor told me and WROTE ON PAPER THAT SHE GAVE ME. So I called 4M, left a message, left my name and MRN, all of that. Nothing. I think maybe 7 calls, including a fax I asked Walgreen's to send, and I didn't hear anything about a medication error. Are you kidding me? I realize I'm on Medi-Cal right now and we're all just garbage junkies, but if you could maybe do the very least thing possible to help me along with inexpensive treatment that is SAFE and non-narcotic, it would be great and I wouldn't have to keep going to the ER for help wasting literally thousands of dollars. Anyway, I received a letter in the mail today telling me, you guessed it! I've missed another valuable appointment at the 4M clinic at SFGH. I left a scathing (yet polite and professional) message to let them know because I don't want to be penalized for missing appointments. Yeah, I know, a poor garbage person like me understands insurance, who'da thunk it? Please get your act together, SFGH. You failed to correct and follow through a rather simple medication issue for me so I can't imagine how you treat patients with clotting disorders, chronic traumatic pain, diabetes, anything that requires communication or care. I was standing up for you guys and the ER care I received but now, I...I'm done. I have a GP who listens, is patient, and who treats me with dignity and respect, not just another piece of cattle with a Medi-Cal number.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Cassidy Carr,"I would give 5 stars to the trauma, orthopedic, urology, anti-coagulant &amp; IM teams.But the pharmacy situation here is so frustrating that I've been approached by a security guard twice for losing my shit.If you've got Healthy SF, I strongly advise making an appointment with your ""home clinic"", which can take weeks. It's the only way they will send your prescriptions to another pharmacy. You'll have to make a potentially bogus trip into your clinic, but otherwise it may take you 3 FULL DAYS or several trips to general (IF you live in the city,I don't) to get meds.One of the more frustrating periods of my life, thanks to their inefficient, zombie like pharmacy staff.It doesn't matter if you have your prescription faxed in, or if they tell you to come back after 5:00 to pick up something- its never ready.One day, they moved me to different lines 5 times.

Sara Cline,"I have never been to an ER in San Francisco, and wasn't sure what to expect. Â I sliced my toe last night pretty badly, and when the bleeding wouldn't stop with pressure, the first hospital I thought of was SFGH, as it's closest to my house. Â  In the car on the way over, I started to second-guess my decision, as I had this idea that I'd be waiting for 4 hours to be seen and that I'd sit in the waiting room bleeding the whole time.  Â  As it turns out, I waited 2.5 hours, but I was triaged immediately, so it was taped with gauze within minutes of my arrival. Â Every single person who helped me, from the guy who brought the wheelchair car-side, to the eligibility specialist, was so kind and friendly despite the noise and chaos going on in the background.  A flood of patients who'd been in on a Muni bus involved in a collision Â arrived shortly after I did, and while I know that Â my simple toe laceration wasn't a priority relative to that situation, both the doctor and head doctor who examined my cut took their time with me and did not make me feel like I was wasting anybody's time. Â  The nurse was funny and efficient, and Â brought me (and my girlfriend!) a warm blanket, and answered all of my questions. Â They left my cut open for a while and the cold air was bothering me, but my girlfriend was able to flag someone down who immediately put gauze back on it. I have insurance, and to be honest, I think if I had a similar injury in the future, I may try a different hospital just to avoid some of the chaos and overcrowding. Â All in all, not as bad as I was expecting. Â I'm sure I would have felt a lot worse if I didn't have my girlfriend with me, but the staff was fantastic and I can't believe everything that they have to deal with.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Jorden Fellows,"I'm cracking up SF General has a yelp page and people actually review it! Â I was trying to google SF General to see how to go about getting my medical records released and decide to take the time to write a review.First of all the care here is amazing because the doctors are UCSF doctors and as part of their rotation they come to General. Â The atmosphere is anything you would expect in a trauma center... traumatizing. Â However, compared to other ER experiences I've had this by far takes the cake.I was crying hysterically when a nurse heard me from the hallway, not even my nurse, and asked if I was ok and if she could do anything for me. Â I told her i was just upset and she stayed with me until my Doctor came back. Â Everyone was super nice and caring. Â Dr. Nick was the best, he was very caring and calmed me down, I even joked around a bit with him, the nurses, and even the Sheriff when all the scary stuff was said and done. Â Everyone there takes their jobs seriously and I don't envy the crap they have to put up with but boy was I glad they were there. Â I bet they were happy I wasn't one of the difficult people, I mean I saw a guy rip out his IV and make a run for it, only to be escorted back by the sheriff. Â If anything it was pure entertainment for me while I sat around.I don't remember a lot about that night but I remember the paramedic telling me they were taking me to general and asked if I knew anything about it. Â I told him I've only heard bad things and I take the 9 bus everyday and the most interesting drugged up people get on the bus. Â He started laughing and assured me that would not be my experience.

Cobie Warren,"I was rushed to the trauma center after being hit on my motorcycle. The medical staff was good at identifying the more potentially life-threatening issues, but once ruled out my other issues were left addressed. As an example they were concerned about internal bleeding and did a great job of getting the Ultrasound / Scan, but when it came to all the road rash I suffered, they neither cleaned nor bandaged my open wounds. After the concern for serious issues had passed, they moved my bed to the hallway. I shared the hallway with a gentleman hand-cuffed to his bed with a Sheriff guarding him, a few homeless people yelling nonsense, and another inmate wearing a face mask because he was spitting on people. To top off the horrible experience, I had to give my statement to the police officer where he required my insurance information. My wife retrieved my leather jacket for the insurance info from a small waiting room located 5 feet from where my bed lay in the hospital. The jacket was stolen! I asked for help from some asian nurse with an eyebrow ring who only gave me attitude and proceeded to move my bed far away from her station. The doctor was fine and most of the ER staff.

Half of the people there look like bums and smell. The average wait time is about two hours and you cannot make an appointment, so you just hav eto come early. When you Â are called you will be seen by a nurse ,not a doctor.Now, if you got directed to a specialist for a specific problem it is better. Tehre won't be any more lines and the Doctors should be qualified. I receive cancer treatment from General Hospital and the Oncology department is great and professional.",2,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Haydn Noel,"Last year I was really really really sick. Like I was coughing up blood sick. I was obsessively checking my temperature and looking up symptoms of bronchitis. I broke down and called my mom and asked her to take me to the doctor. One thing: I didn't have any insurance. So my mom took me to General Hospital and I sit there, trying not to pass out from my 110 degree fever. It took FOREVER. Hours pass by before I even see a nurse. There's another guy in the waiting room whose arm is wrapped in some bloody cloth. Perhaps he should be in the emergency room? It sucks. I can't say that it's entirely General Hospital's fault. It's the fact that this country is FUCKED up and we are beholden to private enterprises for health care. Now that's fucked up.",2,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Lesley Hess,It's funny how SFGH Pharmacy Department after standing after a hour waiting on a script for my brother SFGH has a love hate relationship with patrons when tempers rage it becomes a comedy show or a real live fighting ring cause the staff moves real slowly and the Chinese folks is making others tempers flares up because they can't read and sign they got the right jump others in line waiting for their medication is like waiting on the 30-Stockton bus in Chinatown like I said SFGH has a love hate relationship due to short staff in the hospital.,3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Toni Ryan,"So about a week ago I was casually walking down my stairs, much like I do every day. Only on this day I would miss the last 2 steps, twist my ankle and hear an unholy POP that made me swell up and resulted in an inability to walk and a LOT of pain. After consulting Yelp on where to go for the insurance-less (yeah, I know. Sign up for healthy SF sooner rather than later!) I decided on SF General. My boyfriend loaded me into the car and off we went.I was seen immediately by the triage nurse. Her bedside manner wasn't the best and she would later slam me injured-ankle-first into a wall while pushing my wheelchair, but all seemed well.While waiting in the waiting room we got to catch a glimpse of quite a few characters, offered drugs, etc, etc. I took xrays, then some more, then saw every single person working in the ER. And honestly, the nurses were fantastic. There were two in particular (Mia and Jocelyn..thanks ladies!) that really gave me great advice. The doctor on the other hand...eh. I know they were busy with drunk homeless people but really, she poked me twice, called it a sprain then said I didn't actually need xrays and that was that. Cut to a little over a week later and there's definitly something weird and ouchy going on..but I won't be back there!",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Danica Mccarthy,"A large portion of the patients at SFGH are there for emergency trauma care. A friend of mine was hit by a car while crossing the street last December, so she spent a week here recovering. The several times that I was at SFGH, the emergency room was overflowing with automobile &amp; bike accident victims and with victims of violent attacks (e.g. gang fights).My friend received prompt initial care from the doctors there, but spent about 12 hours in the ER while waiting for an inpatient room to become available upstairs. While waiting, we saw several pretty bad cases. The most memorable to me was a 17 year old kid who had been literally stabbed in the back by one guy while in a fistfight with another. He was already plotting his revenge against his attacker.Another memory from SFGH that stands out were several patients smoking and begging for money just outside the front door to the hospital. That was depressing. I've never seen that at a hospital.The upside is that the 3 doctors attending my friend during her week long stay were first rate. I could tell that these 3 surgeons were experts in their field, their professionalism and the reconstructive facial work they performed were both top notch. I'm not sure if people without health insurance would have access to these doctors though. They might, I just don't know.------------------------------------------The Cafeteria @ SFGH: This is one of only two options for a hot meal in the hospital. I ate at this cafeteria several times when a friend spent a week in the hospital. They pretty much just serve low-grade, but very cheap, cafeteria food. The ""cuisine"" here is exactly what I used to eat in public school cafeterias growing up, but with more options.For higher quality food in the hospital, try the soup &amp; sandwich place right across the hall, if it's open. It's usually closed.",3,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Ihsan Neal,"I was brought here for trauma on a Friday night, at about 7pm; ultimately I was admitted and spent 11 days in the ortho ward. Â I was told (and have found out since) that for trauma SF Gen is the place to go from a quality standpoint - a view that many of the nurses on staff endorsed. Â (""If I got shot, I'd want them to take me here,"" one said.)My ER experience was good, from what I remember - everyone was prompt and professional and I really didn't notice that I wasn't admitted until 2am or so. Â Though I was very heavily medicated at the time. Â I do remember hearing a doctor ask another patient if he ""was hearing the voices now"" and another doctor ask another patient if he got hurt ""before or after shooting up."" Â Such is life in the trauma ward of a general hospital - it is what it is and my care did not suffer for it.I was surprised, pleasantly, by the quality of care that I got here after admission. Â I did not know that SF Gen shares faculty with UCSF and was pleased to find out that they did. Â I was well taken care of by my ortho surgical team - I had two surgeries while I was there - and felt the same way about all but one of the nurses that helped me while I was there.I shared a room, which was fine because my roommate was fine. Â But it could have been bad - I heard many screaming matches between patients and staff, nearly all of which were medication related (as in, patients wanting more of it, and nurses &amp; doctors explaining why there was no more to be had). Â Word to the wise: they will discharge you if you're too much trouble - I heard it happen more than once to cranky neighbors. Â (""Mr. X, we feel that if you're able to wheel yourself out to smoke, you'll be more than capable at home, so it's time for you to leave."")The food is terrible, despite the efforts of the very nice people who make the menu happen, and several times they ""forgot"" to serve my meal. Â So do be aware of that and be sure to bring your friends food if you're going for a visit. Â Jamba juices are like currency there.My ongoing care has been more of a mixed bag, with Ortho continuing to shine and ENT crapping the bed on a few occasions.

Cai Ireland,"Five stars for the trauma unit-- I was hit by a car as a pedestrian two weeks ago, and they were amazing. Â I must say I was pretty unhappy to hear the ambulance paramedics say we were going to General... but he said that's the best trauma unit in the city, and we had to go there. Â They were on it from the second we arrived; I was impressed by the professionalism and intensity of the care. Â Before the backboard and neck brace were ever removed I had been X-rayed and poured over by countless doctors. Â However...Once it became clear that my spine wasn't injured and that the copious amounts of blood were flowing from a head injury that had NOT resulted in brain swelling, I was put in a corner and left to bleed all over myself for the next four hours. Â Now, I understand the the stab wounds and gunshots that came after me were more important... but it took them 15 minutes to wash the blood out of my hair and stitch my wounds.

Lennon Vaughn,"I have had almost completely negative experiences with SF General. Â Let me start by saying that I think the doctors at SF General are at the top of their field. Â They are competent, kind, and altogether brilliant, and I'm thankful that they're there.That said, the remaining staff members range from mediocre to horrendous. Â I'll share a few stories:* I had an appointment in the morning and called the operators to find out what time it was at exactly. Â Like several other experiences I've had there, the phone operators were beyond unhelpful. Â I tried to explain to one woman that I had an appointment that morning and she told me that there were no morning appointments in the clinic. Â After asking her to check the computer, she got huffy with me and hung up! Â On several separate occasions, I have tried to ask the operators a specific question, and they will transfer me to an outside line well before I have even finished the question.* Â I went for a simple blood draw once, and was not even greeted by the medical staff. Â They never looked at me or gave me any kind of acknowledgment, just punctured my vein and let me go. Â I asked the woman who was drawing the blood if I could have a drink of water. Â She gave me a strange look so I repeated it, and she came back with A GLASS OF HOT WATER!! Â  Who are these people?? * Â I became sick one day and went to the Urgent Care to be treated. Â It was busy, so I had to wait for 4 hours before being seen. Â When I finally was seen, I was put into another room for 30 minutes. Â It really didn't help my throat problem to been left in a room with an open window on a chilly February night. Â The Nurse Practitioner was totally unfriendly with me when I finally was seen, and gave me some very glib medical advice. Â I was finished with her in less than 5 minutes. Â As a positive note, I had a very successful minor surgery on my hand there, and all of the doctors were tremendous.

Kai Regan,"I took a day off work hoping it will only get better, but by 5 PM my nightmares began. I had slept for almost 18 hours before I knew I had to go to the ER. Without insurance, I didn't care because my fever + upset stomach was off the hook. I drove myself to the General Hospital around 6 ish. I first wen to registration, then was directed to get screening first to see if I am even qualified to be in the ER. Waited for 15-20 mins then was screened by RN. My temperature was abnormal and heart rate was abnormal. Went to registration did bunch of paper work. Told them I didn't have insurance, but was working. Waited for another 30-45 mins. My name was finally called before everyone else in front of me. I guess my severity was high due to suspicion of appendicitis. Overall, the nurses and the nurse practitioners at the ER was very nice, attentive. They made my stay pleasant. Though I was not discharged until 12:30 AM, I walked out feeling relieved and thankful that I live just 5 minutes from SFGH. Within that 6 hours time frame I was screened, pelvic + rectal examniation, IV fluids, blood + urine test, and cat scanned. They tried their best to make sure I'm not in danger of any infection that needs to be treated immediately. I was sent home relieved knowing that all tests were normal. No major concern.

Â Unless you are are on Medicaid or otherwise have no way or intention of paying your bills then avoid SFGH completely I beg you!If you set foot in the ER, your bill is already over $2500, that is just to get in the door - each treatment you receive is incremental.

Â If you don't believe me or need a good laugh, check out their price list online: sfdph.org/dph/comupg/oseâ¦The city is trying to close the budget gap solely through SFGH it would seem. Â Additionally, since SFGH is in-network for very few medical insurance providers you usually end up paying most of the bill out of pocket. Â Also, because they charge about twice the amount most insurance providers have as the maximum allowable charge you can expect to pay about 60% of your hospital bill.

Teegan Peacock,"SF General is really something else. Reading reviews from being completely negative to praising this hospital to the high heavens, I totally get it. In my opinion, SFGH gets the job done. If you're coming here for a bloody nose or a cut finger, you're most likely going to hate it. After falling about 10 ft. from the roof onto marble, needless to say I needed medical attention. I was brought to St. Marys (which has an insanely caring staff), but because of the trauma I was required to be transferred to SFGH. The nurses at St. Marys warned me about the crowds at General but I had never been so I was oblivious. Everything that's been said about this place is true - it's insanely busy, bums accompanied by cops litter the hallways (although I heard this was true from my bf, since I didn't look past my gurney), you will WAIT for a lot of services, etc. But the good things are true too. Most of the staff I've encountered are impressively trained and caring. The surgeons who worked on me are top notch!

Etienne Wilks,"It's a crap shoot when you go here. Sometimes your experience is ok or fine. Other times it is horrific. Once my boyfriend went in with strep throat and after waiting in urgent care for 6 hours the ""doctor"" sent him home with a prescription for Benadryl. That incident almost landed him in the ICU. It was obvious at the time he presented with a very red throat with white pustules. Classic strep. He was so sick by the time they did give him antibiotics that the infection had gone systemic. We have been intimately involved with SFGH for many years now because by boyfriend had severe hip degenerative hip disease and dual hip replacements as a result. It's funny because the first hip surgery went smooth and the nurses on the ward after surgery were very helpful and compassionate. The second surgery the opposite. He had a lot more pain and difficulty and the nurses on the post op ward were sadistic. Also the bathroom in his room was gas station filthy. Luckily I went to his room before he even got there and Lysoled the whole thing and did a total clean up on the bathroom when he got there and every day he was there. There were pubes all over the toilet and men's whisker shaving all over the sink and mirror shelf. The sad part is housekeeping had just been in the room earlier when a patient was discharged. Â I should've taken photos but I was gagging. Anyway like I said sometimes it's ok and sometimes it's horrid. Put it this way I wouldn't go here unless you have no choice. If you do have to go to general make sure that you bring a book, a crossword puzzle, or some other form of quiet entertainment because the waits can be brutal and a little patience can go a long way. If you bring a laptop or mp3 (etc.) be sure you bring headphones because the other patients will not tolerate the noise and neither will staff. Also if someone you love is admitted as a patient bring a can or bottle of Lysol and a couple of chubs of sanitary wipes and detail their room. Â Good luck and good health to you.PS: An earlier review by Garrett S. commented several times on the attractiveness of the attending physicians in the clinic. He seemed angry that his attractive female physician was ""following around some blond physician..."" The clinics are run by medical students and supervised by residents, etc.. Â So there will be a lot of one physician ""following the others around"". There is nothing at all an air of let's pick up on our doctor or patient or colleague. Frankly I don't see what a persons ""attractiveness"" has to do with anything quality of care related, but as an aside: No, do not go to general to date the staff, physicians or otherwise. It is not worth it.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Ada Wallis,"The fact that I am sitting here with a possible broken ankle all weekend, waiting for my local clinic for the uninsured to open Monday rather than go through the SF General treatment again says a lot. Pondering the decision brings tears to my eyes.  Once, I had injured my shoulder quite bad. When the pain was too much to breath, I went down to General. I handled the long wait, and the stress of filling out paper work while crying and trying to get in shallow breaths through the pain, but that aside, they just treated me as if I was some junkie trying to score pain pills and was mostly disregarded. They gave me an x-ray, said it was fine, and sent me home. Then I had to deal with the billing. They did not accept my poor and uninsured status and started billing me. I had to have roommates write letters stating I was poor. And many years, my shoulder still hurts and does not work the same. And this was nothing compared to when I had an outpatient surgical procedure. They numbed the area of the procedure, but I was awake throughout. The, I assume, Student they had performing the procedure did something that caused a sudden jolt of pain up my body. When I yelped and jumped, she looked at the supervising doctor who looked at her and they both rolled their eyes somewhat dramatically. They did not believe that I had felt any pain. When I went for my follow up, the doctor started to prep me for the procedure all over again. I informed him I already had it and was here to make sure it was healing okay, he deep sighed and said ""you look fine. Still want me to check"". ""Yes. I assume that's why you made the appointment."" He took just seconds and said ""Your fine,"" and left the room. I still receive phone calls from his personal bill collector even though I sent to General by the free clinic and told I wouldn't have these costs because of my lack of income. Â  I was still quite young then and had no idea about anything about receiving medical treatment.Through the whole thing, I felt vulnerable and lost and ended up hurt and with years of bill collector harassment and what seems to be a lifetime of pain.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Zane Wiggins,"You tell them personal information regarding your health and they started to make jokes after when you are done. I caught them talking about me when I forgotten something and went back after a few minutes of walking out of urgent care center. They were discussing my personal information that I gave to the nurse and doctor openly in the urgent care facility among themselves. It was very unprofessional and that makes them untrust worthy of your personal information.There were 5 people in the facility, doctors, assistants, Â nurses and other staff. I wanted to file a formal complaint but I was too sick to do that.ps. Every time when I go there, I have to wait at least 4 hours or more. Sometimes other people cut in line too. Sometimes I was there way earlier than other people and they get to go in first. I pay around $800 for each medical visit. It's never a speedy visit. Waiting for 8 or more hours to be seen isn't unusual.Some of those people shouldn't be in the medical field. The impression I got every time when I go there is that they are heartless. I think the doctors there that are making $100,000 a year are wasting resources along with other heartless medical personnel in the hospital. They walk around taking an easy as if they are just stalling time so their shifts can end. Â When they retire they'll get a nice pension. I personally think that part of the reason why the state/city is going broke is because of the government feeding/paying these useless people a lot of money for doing nothing.pps, if you want to live longer stay out of the hospital unless you are a important person that has a lot of money.

Jenna Gutierrez,"If there was a way to give them negative 100, I would. I was told it might be a great idea to mention the way they treat people everywhere we can, so this is my input. Again, i have seen other people suffer unimaginable pain from the hands of these pricks, so I am not the only one. I have a long-standing diagnosed radiation-induced thyroid resistance (condition in which case your body rejects your own thyroid hormones, causing you to become severely and so far untreatably hypothyroid). On the course of a few years, your face and body gets deformed, you become permanently and seriously swollen, you go almost bald, your organs slowly fail, your body rejects nutrients, electrolytes, you are unable to walk, think, eat, function...I won't go into details but its as debilitating as it is dangerous. To prove the illness, a serious work-up of tests is done and a thyroid panel is not enough for diagnosis. Needless to say, with a complex and serious issue like this I was stupid enough to seek help a few years ago at SFGH-at that moment I had no support from anyone, (my family consisted of Â dead-beat parents who are absorbed in their artistic adventures somewhere overseas), and my ex who was not just unsupportive but abusive once I became disabled. With all this in tow, while working and struggling through illness and dealing with unlivable situation at home, i had to seek help from SFGH believing in the good nature of Â health professionals. And it did not go well. With diagnosis in hand, I spent a year begging to see an endocrinologist, i spent a year more being bounced between 'resident doctors"" and students who refused to do any sort of work-up, refused to contact specialists or attributed my symptoms to 'rapid aging"" (I am barely over 30), ""depression"" (especially 40-pound overnight swelling and hair loss), or 'she must be taking something because her thyroid tests look OK."" On my feeble attempts to explain that they must do Â certain work-up and not ""thyroid tests"" as described all over the endocrinology magazines and books, I was laughed at, shoved out of doctor's offices (it's all one hospital so hence, one system) and eventually my perpetual begging for help and their adamant refusal to even investigate my illness ended up in them labeling me as ""mental"" or 'delusional"" (on the grounds that ""the illness I might have is rare"") and slandered in SFGH medical records. Which, of course, I didn't know nothing about. When i finally after begging, crying and humiliating myself got to see a specialist, he read the slander and without even a slightest attempt at testing me slandered me as well. I was living with my current partner and we decided to go to all the appointments together. We managed to get to the ""specialist""-an aggressive and moody jerk of a man-to finally do the proper bloodwork that, voala, came back ABNORMAL proving me right. It freaked him out, because he and the ""primary care"" provider had illegal, insulting psychiatric 'assumptions"" scribbled all over my medical records. When the tests came, this dude at first avoided us. Â I Â was already permanently disabled, on advanced stages of disease. After Â us tracking him down we finally got to see him, and during our visit he told us avoiding eye contact that my blood tests are 'totally fine"". Based on which information, he started to treat me with aggression, called me a liar and a faker in his office, in the face of visible and obvious symptoms (shocking to my poor boyfriend) tried to pin on me that I am taking something to make myself look this way (that is after me losing my home, favourite job, and health due to illness) and painfully yanked my hands after I tried to show him how my skin has changed and asked him why he never examined me in 6 months. My boyfriend got a bit perplexed and angry, but we left. After a month of pondering, we requested my records and the truth came out-not only this dude ""misread"" my blood tests in his chart, but he also could not do anything about the previous malpractice and perpetuated the slander and labeling in my records to appease the head of endocrine department and the person who called herself my 'primary"". Neither of us liked what we have seen, to be honest, it drove me to tears. We started looking into legal advice, and ended up going to see this guy again. Of course, we had to POLITELY question him about his frivolous and offensive writing and intentional ""errors"" in my diagnosis. Which triggered him to lose his temper and AS I WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR WITH MY CANE, he lunged at me in an attempt to grab me by the throat. I screamed, my boyfriend quickly intercepted the man as the ""doctor"" kept trying to reach me, it took him good 10-15 minutes to give up on hurting me and then he looked at my boyfriend and thanked him for ""being there, I don't know what I would have done"".

Eliot Goulding,"I will be brief, If you are wealthy, I am not writing this for you. I have to say that my experience recently at SF general was beyond exemplary for this simple reason: i recieved actual compassion. I had a horrible viral infection, and no insurance, and yes, I had to go at 4 in the morning (I did so strategically to out-wait all the drunks. Nurse Marissa and her attending med students 'Kyle,' and 'Nicole,' I think (I could be wrong on the young lady's name), were so kind to me, and worked really diligently to determine the cause of my illness. I so appreciated these noble, under-appreciated soldiers. They work selflessly in a very challenging environment, and I just can't say thank you enough! So what that I will receive a ridiculous bill; I could be dead, and that's way more expensive. Simply - Thank You, Thank, You Thank You.",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Chandler Heaton,"My boyfriend cracked his head open and they gave him some pretty good care. Not horribly slow, and the nurses were awesome awesome awesome. As for the ""atmosphere"" take it or leave it.i think people who complain about how many gross people are in the waiting room here do so because they don't realize that the city is full of these same disgusting ass people. Just because you have to sit with them for a few hours doesn't mean it is a bad hospital . It means that you are seeing a true cross section of your fair city. So while you raise our rents and taking away our needle exchanges and forcing us out of our homes, remember this: The more we are down and out, the sicker we'll get. And when we're sicker, you'll have to share your hospital space with us more.So maybe instead of complaining about SF General, you should mind your own business and quit gentrifying the Mission and the inner city. That way, there wouldn't be quite as many sick people. Y'ever think about that?",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Tyler Duggan,On April 10th 2010 I was rushed to the San Francisco General Hospital because I was in a car accident and was not able to see nor use my legs.

The nurses,residents and doctorswere all focused,considerate and professional in everyway.My only complaint is that the bathrooms were quite dirty and appeared never to have been cleaned in the triage area during my 10+ hour visit.I saw cleaning personnel,but they appeared unwilling to clean the bathrooms,which showed strong evidence of fecal and urine matter.They almost looked like highway restrooms.Another sour observation is that this city appears wholly unprepared for any sort of public health crisis.C'est la vie.",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Micah Ratcliffe,"i WISH i could give negative stars, but yelp seems to be the optimistic around here.i am STILL irate about how general hospital has treated my wife and i. in the past 3 months, we went thru finding out we're pregnant, to dealing with the miscarriage that just happened. throughout this whole time, general made me feel as tho i should be punished for being a father that wanted to be with his wife through the whole pregnancy. i was never allowed in the rooms with her regardless of her requesting it time and time again. even when she had an allergic reaction the the sedative they gave her, they would NOT let me come in to try to console her.the ONLY reason i was given, which was given to me sharply and without any eye contact, was that ""males are not allowed in the rooms"". my wife and i have decided that even tho we can't really afford it, we're going to have to try to find some sort of medical plan so that we NEVER have to deal with general ever again.i've had to deal with general way too many times where i felt like i was just another cow in the herd. i realize that they have to deal with the scum of the earth every day, all day. but not everyone who doesn't have a whole lot of money is a drug addict hood who's there only to try to score some vicodin. some people are there because they actually NEED a hospital, and maybe, just MAYBE, you treating them like a human being would be helpful.so really, NEG 4 stars for General Hospital. it would be -5, but i really liked the chai tea i bought out front at the stand.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Casey Guerrero,"So about a month ago I was hit by a car crossing the street....I was quickly put into an ambulance, the EMTs went to work on me and then the dreaded words came out of one of the EMT's, ""We are taking you to the general.""This is when the panic hit me. For some reason going to General Hospital made me more nervous then the thought of my possible injuries. This is when I Â started to scream at every EMT and ensure them that I do have insurance and that I will pay!! After my panic attack I have a slight memory of the main EMT getting real serious with me and telling me that getting hit by a car was a trauma and General Hospital has the only trauma unit in the city, so I had no choice. I could only think of the horrible stories I have heard about this place and was convinced that I was done.Once we got to the ER I was immediately yelled at by some big male nurse to get off the phone....OK so I was on the phone in the ER, but someone did need to know that I was in this place. I was immediately put into a private room, but because I was taped down I couldn't see the decor. When my mom got there shortly she looked around and asked me why I was in the pediatric unit?!?!?! Well...I didn't have my ID when I was hit, so hey I guess I look under 18?!?! One star just for that!!They ripped off all my clothes, including my skin tight skinny jeans. They almost cut them off, but I convinced the nurse to unstrap me and let me assist her in taking them off before she whipped out the scissors. I had a full body exam and was poked by many objects. I feel like every resident, nurse and doctor came into that room to look at me. I had x rays and an ultrasound and every test one could imagine. The nurses even acted as secretary for me and fielded phone calls from my room from frantic friends and family.I ended up walking out of this place 5/6 hours later, A OK. Everyone at the hospital was great and did everything very quickly and efficiently. The only time I saw any of the scary people I feared in the hospital is when I walked my sore ass out of there, (they keep all of those people in the hallway.)",5,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Stella Kramer,"Having come from a state blessed with advanced and up-to-date health care (and fabulous hospital architecture), I had thought I wouldn't quite make it out of SF General alive.

I had emergency surgery and every resident, nurse, etc. I interacted with was humane, friendly, and kind. Yes, I had to share a room and yes I had to wait in line for a million hours for blood drawing and xrays, but everyone was willing to help and all the assorted ""characters"" hanging out around the hospital were even nice to me when they saw I couldn't even walk or push the elevator button.

Arianne Coles,"This is where ""po"" people like me go to get their uninsured ailments dealt with. This dinosaur is almost in ruins. It looks like out of an apocalyptic movie as one part of it is literally a giant hole in the ground. The clientele looks like a special episode of ""Cops"". I had to go to urgent care to get a gross oozing on my ankle looked at. BTW, they only take cash and have no ATM! So you have to go to another building to get money and return to pay before you are seen. You also should go early, not late. I went late, waited 3 hours and was turned away. Next day that I went I found out they have no doctors, just nurses. Hmmm, no doctors in a hospital??? I waited another excruciating 3 hours and was seen. I was misdiagnosed as having a fungal infection and then the nurse left for a bit and looked it up on the Internet. She came back with a printout. Oh, you have Lyme Disease!!! Yes, I was hiking and apparently had a tick bite. How insane was it if she had not looked that up? Fucking Lyme Disease!!! Google that shit. Yikes. To her credit I did get antibiotics and it did heal up and I got some good advice.Separately I had to go there to get an X-ray for a sprained foot. If you use Healthy San Francisco they send you there to get this done. It was better. No wait and a nice nurse helped me.

Miley Hook,"Since I don't have insurance (I'm unemployed, and my unemployment benefits have run out), I went to the emergency room at ""County,"" as one person called it. I ended up staying 7 hours, and the doctor made an appointment for me in February without telling me or getting my permission. I suspect that it will involve others, since there was a mention of ""overbooking."" I was told it involved educating people on how to avoid getting kidney stones. I'm already aware of how to do that. I need to get mine removed. Now.The nurse in the emergency room inserted a needle into my vein, telling me that ""they"" would want to hydrate me. ""They"" never did. I resent the unnecessary pain. Later, she struggled with the blood pressure monitor, at one point tightening it until I thought I was I was going to ""lose it.""Even though the doctor knew I had kidney stones, I had to ask for water. As fellow sufferers know, you're supposed to hydrate constantly.Conversely, when I finally had the CT, they wanted me to drink two bottles of barium to ""get contrast."" I was then given more water to drink. The CT tech's annoyance was obvious when I told her I needed to go to the bathroom (steel yourself for the experience).The report I got told me NOTHING about the stones themselves, i.e., how big they are now and where they're located. Urologists want that information.A doctor thought I should want to ""get to know ""my urologist. All I want to know, Doctor, is if he or she is competent. I don't want to be ""friends."" I don't care what that person has for dinner or what they like to do on weekends.Warning: the hospital is pushing a health plan they back. I've called that plan.

I've come in there once before (with no insurance) due to this same pain and got pain medicine to reduce it and all went well, but this time, again with no insurance, came in for the same pain and was denied help. They led me out back to the waiting room and I asked to lay down because the pain went through my side as well and they said ""nope"". So I moved some chairs around and laid down on the floor while I waited for my friend to pick me up, the nurse I had talked to saw me and said ""You can't lay on the ground"" so I sat and started puking from the pain over and over again. I was driven to the Concord John Muir Medical Center and had to have emergency surgery to get my appendix removed, which they did the next morning. I would never recommend SF hospital to anyone, as they cannot deny patients without insurance (which I've been told by multiple people) and I've seen another review on this hospital about a patient who didn't have insurance but was treated.

Peyton Lindsey,"I was seen in SFGH's Wound Clinic for a finger infection after going to my primary care Dr and a couple of emergency room visits later. I am extremely happy to be treated with warmth and compassion by the nurses and the doctors in the clinic. They were all so accommodating. I saw Dr. Cambell first and he gave me the option to see the specialist the following day. He kept it real and he even made me laugh a bit. It was clear that they had to lance my finger and I was extremely anxious about the local anesthesia, but Joannie, a nurse held my hand and helped me breath through the process. Dr. Hansen, the specialist is all-pro and I recall him asking me to let him know when I was ready before the procedure. That made all the difference for me. He was the first Dr. to place control in my hands. I continued to go to the clinic for follow-up visits so they could clean and monitor the wound and change my dressing. I am healing nicely and I have new baby skin. Please note, the SFGH Wound Clinic works on a drop-in basis with specific hours and there are days that they are closed.

Harper Nguyen,"Updated: New bills appearing. We have finally worked out that if you are unfortunate enough to visit SFGH, you will be billed by the Hospital separately from any billing by SFGH Medical Group. Hospital is ""facilities"".

For the moment, I cannot even find a person to whom SFGH Medical Group reports, as an example of a billing obfuscation tactic.Summary: top medical staff and care, unfortunately brought down by the attitude of Â administrative staff and very grey-area processes that are well designed to take advantage of the ""customers"".

Ho Farmer,"so i finally felt the need to write my first review. funny how i'd write about a hospital instead of a restaurant. oh well. maybe it's because i've just recently moved to san francisco, but this place is something else. i spent the entire day there today for a non-life threatening emergency. it was the most fun i've had on a sunday in a while. i mean, this is no patch adams, it's just pure absurd urban fun. i crawl my way in, and the (two!) cops stationed at the door start cracking jokes about me and my miserable leg. the triage nurse is out of central casting, handsome young man with a constant smirk and a fair bit of hairgel. the priceless ones were my fellow emergencees... wow. i mean, half of them were actually referred to the psych ward before being seen by a doctor. and trust me, with good reason. so it took a while for my treatment to come through, and even though nobody had any idea what was wrong with me, they pumped me up with vicodine and i cheered up. in that regard, they were quite generous with everyone else, too. they were quite understanding when i had to take an hour-long conference call right in the corridor while ortho was trying to straighten my leg. and they spoke softly, too, so all that was coming out on the other hand was some crazy announcements (""puerto rican sue, page me on 12"") and the noise of the shackled dudes pacing up and down with a couple of cops each. i did feel a little spooked when i overheard cops chatting about how a cop had gotten hurt and specifically asked to be taken elsewhere, and they said ""with good reason"". but hey, i had an amazing time, they were kind and accommodating as hell, and the cast of characters was priceless. my reading the new yorker made me stick out like a sore leg, but at least with all the time there i got to finish it for the first time in weeks. top notch for fun. don't go there if there are ten gunshot wound in front of you, as there often are.

Â Yes, you will have to wait several hours if you are not an emergency case, and yes, there will most likely be crazy people and homeless people in there with you. Â Welcome to San Francisco, and to the world of healthcare in a big city. Â But it is hands-down the best healthcare you will receive, along with UCSF, and General is sure to have paperwork on hand to scale the costs to fit your income if you are balancing on the poverty line. Â If you are a working resident who cannot afford insurance, look into the Healthy San Francisco program, where you can name General as your primary hospital and receive free or low cost assistance.The staff at SFGH are attentive, empathetic, and very skilled at what they do.

Â Oh, snap! so when a guy you happen to think is pretty fantastic gets his face bitten off by some strange dog (a stray. Â NOT A ROCKET DOG! Â i think the dog was a golden retriever...those dogs are NUTS!), this is the place to be. Â the triage ran smoothly and patients seemed to move through with relative speed. Â speaking of speed, nowhere is it more apparent that this is SF's drug of choice. Â which might explain the nurse's having to beg people not to piss on the floor. Â le sigh. minus one star because they refused to help the gentleman with a lump on his nutsack. Â the ER workers kept referring him to a hospital in another city but he insisted he could not get there until monday by which time, ""my nuts will have fallen off"". Â i only know this because the man was pretty much yelling about his nutsack and the lump on it to the entire waiting room for about 10 minutes. Â at one point, he turned around to address the waiting room with, ""these bitches ain't gonna help me and i've got a lump between my groin and my anus on my nutsack! Â man, fuck this!"" Â if guinness gave a record for how many times a human being could say the word, ""nutsack"" in five minutes well then ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. Â despite his kookiness and the fact that the lump was moving locations on his body (from nutsack to between groin and anus to mid thigh to foot okay joking about the last two), I did feel bad for the man and kinda hoped they would give him some medication. Â I mean, it's now tuesday...does he still have his nutsack? Â I worry. I bet the ER is popping off tonight as it is 4th of july (trash holiday of choice) and every moron in town is setting off bottle rockets, snakes, squiggles, exploding turtles, etc., including this bitch next door who keeps yelling, ""woooOOOoooOOO!"" Â in fact, if a firecracker doesn't take her out, i think i will. Â i have fantasies of heading next door with a shovel and right before i knock the bitch out, i will yell, ""woooOOOOooooOOO!"" Â it would be sweet street justice.",4,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Juno Fletcher,"I haven't been to SF General as a patient but being a Healthy SF patient, I've had to visit their pharmacy on a number of occasions. I won't be going back if I can help it because I'm seriously afraid that one day an angry, fed-up customer is going to open fire on everything that moves in that place. This so-called pharmacy has the absolute worst staff, front and back. First you have to stand in line for ages to declare that you've arrived to pick up your meds, which might or might not be ready no matter how many days ago you called it in. If you're lucky and they're ready, you are then sent to another line to pay. You wait some more while the cashier picks and pokes around and then gives you a receipt so that you can get back in the original line and wait some more for your meds. One evening when I was there, the pharmacy tech started to hand me my meds, only to withdraw his hand from the window when I reached for them. Then, I kid you not, he turned to his co-worker and began a discussion about where he and his wife should go on vacation. I leaned over sideways to catch his eye and he gave me a dirty look. I also saw them turning away a diabetic because his medication ""wasn't ready."" When the man protested that he'd been coming in for three days in a row and hadn't had his medicine for two days already, they ignored him. After all, if he goes into a diabetic coma, it's the ICU or the morgue for him, not their department. In other words, lives and health are being jeopardized by these hateful people. And it goes without saying that many of them don't wear name badges or else wear them so the names don't show. That place needs to be cleaned out entirely and restaffed with people who give a rat's ass about what they're doing. The people who work there now deserve to be in jail for criminal negligence. You cannot run a pharmacy as if it were a fourth-rate bar and grill.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital
Misha Spooner,"I think the only thing I really wanted to point out was the fact that I was misled through my phone call.. I got into a car accident a few weeks ago and I stopped by the SFGH the day after and before that, I made a phone call to make sure I knew where to go. Â I asked if I were suppose to go to the Adult Urgent Care and they told me to go to the Emergency Room instead so that's what I did.. Then I waited almost half an hour just to go in and have them tell me to go to Adult Urgent Care. Â I mean, not only was it rainy and windy that day and THOUGH the walk is not far, it's just a hassle to have to bust my ass there in the rain. Â Wait was long but what hospital wait isn't long, right? The nurses were really nice as well as the doctor so I can't complain but it's just the misleading phone call that blew me off, really..

Kaisha Branch,"I can't say how dissapointed I was when I stumbled into this ER after a drunken bar fight with my brother. We were chillin at Thee Parkside (potrero hill) when my bro hit me ""accidently"" over the head with his cocktail and needless to say I was livid! I threw him over a table and he kicked my feet out from under me and I hit my head on the floor. Lots of blood and gin.. As his apology to me he took me to the ER at General and left me to fend for myself. The intake nurse looked like she had been up for 48 hrs and was ready to flop over herself. I almost forgot about my bleeding head to worry about her for a minute. This place is a homeless encampment and just because I didn't look homeless and was asking to be hurried trough( the bars close at 2) I didn't get helped for over 7hours. Lets just say enough time to be completely sober and beginning to get hungover. They would have left me for dead if it were up to them.

Rudi Harris,I went to Urgent Care because my knee was unstable. I was having extreme pain just walking and my knee would give out. The very rude ass doctor Aldo Gomez in urgent care kept on lecturing me saying I should not be there. He repeated it OVER &amp; OVER. He also misdiagnosed me saying I'm fine. I ended up having surgery because I went back to see another doctor who correctly referred me to the orthopedics. Two stars because of the low cost.

Shola Gomez,"ok, i am sure they dont give a shit. and i get its a public hospital. i am glad we have one, so those of us minus insurance have somewhere to go. but i have had 3 horrifically bad experiences in here. one. i was retarded ass sick, had a rash and yada yada...it was pretty rough. go in. wait 8 hours to be seen. no one checks in. when you ask they are mean. everyone who is coming in after me is getting in...so i ask again. i am in really bad pain and it is 20 times more painful to sit. yet all i can do is sit for 8 hrs while passed out drunks and crackheads gets bed. nice. finally get in after they lost my file, forgot about me, said i had a room...then didnt and sent me back....i get seen. and i tell them my med history with about 3 interuptions and barely listening. someone else comes in and takes over, i have to tell the entire thing over. i tell them i think it is sickness x. (u all dont need to know my med biz) they tell me no, its sickness y. i say are you sure and ask for full bloodwork. no. they send me off with a prescription.two. i come back bc guess what, it got worse and more clearly has become sickness x. i wait 5 hours. ruder than the first time. i have a drunk crazy guy groping me in the waiting room. when i tell him to lay off he freaks out, spits on me and starts screaming. do the 3 cops right there come over, nope. they are talking. i get in and tell them about my last visit and that i am so sick now its ridculous. i say its sickness x i think and ask for tests to confirm. they do it. say no, its sickness z. more drugs. send me home. three.i am feeling like death. for real. worse than i ever felt in my life. i miss 4 days of work. go back in. wait about 7 hours. i am crying bc it is so hard to sit down. so i lay on the floor bc its that bad, a cop yells at me and treats me like a crackhead drunk. who is about 80percent of the people around me. nice. i get in there and tell them this is sickness x and they have told me its sickness y, z, etc. ask about my tests. they are botched. no communication. no calls. they just fucked up on visit 2 and oh well. i get my tests and some more tests and some more tests. guess what, its sickness x. apparently i can go on web md and diagnose myself better than doctors. they dont seem to care and i get the correct prescription and go home.here is the best part.next day i get my insurance card, i go to davies.they are nice. i am seen in 45 minutes. and i have sickness x. and i am so sick bc of it and my existing medical issues, that i get an infection that ALMOST KILLS ME. if i didnt go into the hospital and get treated properly, i could have died. my immune system is trashed. i miss like 2 weeks of work and pay.here is what kills me...not only did i say what i knew pretty much was wrong. but i was nice and patient and not a drunk crackhead. i had my medical history. i was thorough with them. i asked questions. i was treated like a piece of shit. no one was nice to me all 3 visits except one lady who worked registration. this is the saddest excuse i have ever seen for a hospital. i was actually even referred to as ""that one"" and not a name. or she. or this patient. they didnt even look me in the eye. i am sad that health care is this bad. i am sad people are this rude and care so little they cant treat you with respect. i am sad the people that work here dont listen to patients. i know my body. i am sad they screwed up all my labwork. i have been told to sue by a half dozen people, but that would take away shitty health care for someone else who needs a misdiagnosis. rather than spending hundreds of thousands tree lining divisadero or getting new traffic signs or talking muni shelters...can we get a decent hospital for folks without insurance. instead of looking at the internet before i leave, i can press a button that tells me when the next bus is....but i cant get a proper blood test and get better at general? seriously.",1,Zuckerberg San Francisco General Trauma and Hospital,General Hospital

Winifred Mack,"Fuck medicare. Fuck medicare. One more time, Fuck you medicare. It's because I ""outgrew"" the medicare system that I was forced to find some health insurance. Me being a student who couldn't afford to pay Blue Crosses' bullshit prices had to be on San Francisco Health Plan, which they make it a point to remind you is NOT health insurance. Now if I want my medication, I have to stand in one line that may take two hours just to give them my prescription paper and another line that takes uber long to pick the medication up. And even in the pick-up line, it's not certain that you will be able to pick your medicine up, often the ""pharmacists"" go through the bureaucratic bullshit, and you have to lobby and fight to get your medicine. It's garbage. SF General hospital, to my knowledge has never been worth the upkeep. But many like myself depend on fucking medicine (Advair for my bullshit asthma) just so I could breathe normally. I'm going to have to wait many years until I get my Masters, then find a job whereby I'd be able to afford health care and get out of this assembly line from hell.

They strap me down and was about to bring me to a private hospital. Luckly I was still awake and realized I didn't have insuranced so yelled out general hospital. Well after being treated in surgery and many pain killers I recovered with a nasty scar on the top of my head. The nice people at general hospital realized I didn't have money and told me what to do to have my 20g bill reduced. In the end, my huge bill ended up to being 10dollars.

Jess Parrish,"My 3-year old daughter took a bad fall while we were watching the Chinese New Year Parade. Â The ER staff took great care of her - they rushed her right in, were very kind and gentle to her and they quickly made her feel very comfortable as they did their evaluations. Â Fortunately, it wasn't anything too serious, but the initial doctors on call were great with her as were the pediatricians that they called in to have a second look. Â They all made what could have been a very scary and confusing experience into something that felt reasonable and effective. Â The waiting room outside the ER's a little scary and there was a brief lockdown while we were there - fortunately, they have a guard there but waiting in the ER with a 3 year old at 11pm while my husband went to fetch our car at Millbrae BART was probably my least favorite part of the whole night. Â It was nearly impossible for my husband to catch a cab where the staff told him to wait, so he ended up taking a bus with our 5-year old to BART to our car in Millbrae.

Wade Mullen,"I've had good experiences with Dignity Urgent care, so this is just an isolated incident. I went to the West Portal location for an exam on Monday, 8/9, nothing related to COVID. The folks there who helped me were attentive. My issue is that the PA who examined me was wearing a neck gaiter rather than a mask. That didn't seem appropriate. I think that it's been known for a while that neck gaiters don't provide the same level of protection of others as a mask does, and a study just released to media yesterday said that gaiters can actually be more problematic than not wearing a mask at all. I was in the small exam room within six feet of the provider for at least ten minutes, and then another five minutes after he returned from researching a question for me. Because the PA is a front-line worker, I realize he has a higher risk of being infected, and I am now concerned about possible exposure. I was wearing a mask, but it's unclear how much protection masks provide the wearer.I tried to reach the clinic or Dignity-GoHealth to find out what their policy is on neck gaiters and employee face coverings in general, and how often their clinicians are tested, but it's not possible to the clinic of Dignity's SF headquarters by phone. I understand this is a busy time for clinics, but it also seems like there should be some way to reach them to report this and make sure the PA wears a medical-grade mask from now on. Hopefully all is fine, but if a provider gets infected and is wearing a gaiter rather than a mask, they could infect people coming into the clinic. I have no problem with the medical service I got yesterday, but I do have a problem with a clinician not wearing a real mask and with not having any means of reporting this.",4,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Making an appointment online was easy. I checked in a little before my appointment time. Check in process was easy. I got roomed 10 minutes after checking in and vitals were taken. I was told the physician was with the person a head of me and that she was being a ""few minutes"". Well, a ""few minutes"" turned nearly to two hours !!! After almost two hours of waiting in the room to be seen by the physician on duty, I decided to walk out and leave. On my way out, the staff were just hanging out in the front, chatting it up. Not once in those two hours did someone come in to check in on me. I had to leave the room twice, in fact, to add money to my meter (a total of 3 hrs of parking is what I ended up paying for).At one point I walked out of the room to see if they had forgotten about me. I bumped into the clinician who looked like she was charting. She did say she would be with me as soon as she was done as I was next and she just had finished with the previous patient before me. But she never came. Evidentially, she skipped me and went in with another patient !!!Hey, big news flash, my time is just as valuable as yours ! The least you could do is treat a patient with a bit more respect and empathy. I have a legitimate reason as to why I came in. I will NEVER try one of your urgent cares ever again.

Tye Mayo,"We made our first visit on July 30th to the West Portal branch. The online reservation was easy and the check-in process went okay.We met a NP for bone fracture possibility, and took a x-ray. The clinician and NP made it clear that the radiologist would review photos and provide the final diagnosis on the following date. At the check-out, they Â didn't provide us the receipt for our payment because additional charge might cause in a couple of days according to them.  We haven't heard anything from the team after 3 business days, I had to call them to follow up. The receptionist who picked up call was extremely unfriendly and very bossy. No customer service was made at all. It was urgent for us to find whether the injury is a bone fracture or sprains before seeing a referred doctor. It was such a waste time without knowing the x-ray result. I asked a receptionist how long it takes to get a final confirmation from a doctor and she was very rude saying ""you guys just need to wait"" So the promise that the NP and clinician made was definitely fell off, and it sounded like an unprofessional and disrespectful receptionist at West Portal branch made comments whatever she wanted to say.

It was actually the best experience I ever had at an Urgent Care clinic!1) Very easy to schedule an appointment --- I called in the morning to set up a same day appointment. They asked what time I would be available to come and I told them after work around 6:15 pm, and they right away set me an appointment for 6:30 pm.2) The wait time was minimal --- I got there around 6:15 pm. I had to fill out the registration form because this was my first visit. It took them about 5 minutes to enter my information to the system and (not more than) 5 minutes later they called my name!3) Great location --- It's very easy to get there. It's only 5 minutes away (walking) from West Portal Station.4) Very clean and neat --- The clinic looks new! They have a very comfortable waiting room. Also, if you bring your kids, there's a ""kids section"" in the corner. They provide two tablets/iPads on a small kids table (and chairs) in the waiting room.5) Hours --- One thing that I like the most is ... I don't have to leave early from work (or come late to work) because they open 15 hours a day! On the weekdays, they open from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm! Also, It's great that even on Saturday and Sunday, they open from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm!6) Staff, Nurse, Doctor --- They are all friendly and very knowledgeable! Dr. William was a very nice doctor.

Â Believe all the negative reviews re. poor billing practices. Â I dropped into the West Portal Urgent Care back in Feb. 2017 and provided 2 forms of insurance. Â Now I'm getting letters in the mail from my secondary insurance provider saying that the 'lab that the West Portal clinic sent my samples to needed to first bill my primary insurance'...? Â To top it off, I received a bill from the West Portal clinic for the balance owed of $150+, and they're only giving me 2 weeks to pay? Â Of course the bill didn't arrive until recently so I only had 1 week to pay.... Â Again, I have 2 forms of insurance and rarely pay anything when I go to any other medical facility. This is so odd. The actual services were just as wonky as their billing practices. Â For instance, I called several hours before coming in and the receptionist said ""no need to make an appt. as walk-ins are welcome"". I come in and the receptionist asks if I have an appt.? Â Their TV screen displaying the queue also notes clients as ""walk-in"" vs. ""appt."" Then, front desk staff tell me that it's a great night, very short wait! Â Well guess what, after waiting 2+ hours twiddling my thumbs in the exam room, the ""Physician Assistant"" finally comes into my room and complains about how busy she is and how the other PA called out sick.

I made an online appointment for 12:42p and received the reminder text message to come to the clinic as my appt was coming up. I got there 15 minutes early and was asked to sign in on the tablet and take a seat. After 40 minutes I ask the front desk how long it's going to take and she asks me why I didn't let them know I was here. This first thing I did when I came in was say hi to the other women at the front desk who asked me to check in. My name was also clearly listed on the computer of checked in patients in the lobby since the time I arrived. They both seemed confused and after another 15 min I'm finally called for a total of 1 hour waiting for an appointment.I'm not one to complain but it's irritating to see them allow patients to wait when they made an appointment and most likely did so because they have commitments like work or school. It would have been nice for the staff at the front desk to acknowledge me in the waiting lobby when they realized they didn't sign me correctly instead of having their side conversations the whole time I was there waiting. 3 stars for the nurses and PAs that I was seen by who apologized for the wait and were helpful",3,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

The first time I went I was very scared and nervous for the bandage to come off for the first time (I had initially went to Davies ER when it happened), the doctor said she didnt want to remove the gel foam that was directly on my wound and to come back a second time in 5 days to take it off. She was very nice and gentle with how she handled my finger- I was in a panic when she unwrapped the bandage for the first time but she put me at ease by doing it slowly and gently. The second time i came was a horrible experience- I had an appointment but it took over an hour to be seen. The male doctor that redressed my bandages did not make me feel as calm as the lady that helped me the first time- he said I may have an abcess under the gel foam because there was a little pus coming out- so he proceeded to give me three of the most painful numbing shots ever in my finger- I was basically screaming and crying and writhing in my chair as he poked and prodded my now swollen finger to draw out the ""abcess"". After he jammed a needle into my wound many times- he said there was actually no abcess and sent me off with a simple band aid. It just seemed like he wanted to move on to the next patient and get it over with- I understand you're the only doctor but bedside manner should be a priority...

Â The visit was fine, I was told by the nurse that a nurse would be in touch with me in few days for the result.Fast forward to few days ago, when I didn't hear back in few days, I followed up. The nice gentleman who answered the phone put me on hold twice, the second hold was for 40 minutes. F.O.R.T.Y. minutes!!! Lucky I had the phone on speaker at work while I was working, otherwise I'd have to see a chiropractor for my neck!Then he sounded incredibly stressed out, and said that all the nurses are busy and that one would call me back in few hours. That was around 10 am.I understood how hectic things can get, but it was around 3 pm, and I still had not heard anything back from them. I called them, put on hold, and this time, a nice lady answered the phone. She wasn't all that nice, because all she kept doing was trying to hang up the phone.

This was our first time at Golden Gate UC. The staff were super friendly as soon as we walked in. Very well organized and super clean and nice. The monitors on the wall let you know where in line you are and how long your wait will be. Once my other half was called to be seen by the Doctor, I took off to the Starbucks that was very close by. My other half told me that the Doctor was very friendly and helpful. We were in and out in an hour. I would definitely recommend and use this place if I need quick medical attention.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Macey Amos,"I was referred here by UCSF urgent care because they were about to close. I was a walk in and was in &amp; out in less than an hour. I had gotten a insect bite two days prior. My entire forearm had swollen up, was hot and I had a lingering headache. The staff was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. The PA that saw me was informative and quite nice. I was told if my PCP wasn't able to see me within 2days to come back there for a follow up at no cost. If I have any other urgent matter for myself or my children I would definitely bring them here. Bonus: there is a Walgreens directly across the street. They also accept Insurance..",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Campbell Allison,"I needed urgent care for some second degree burns, and I found this place through my insurance. The waiting area is nice, with an iPad to check in and a monitor displaying the wait time for patients. You can make appointments online, but I did a walk-in Monday at noon, and there was hardly a wait. The doctor and nurse were efficient, and I was all bandaged up and ready to go within the hour. They also provided me with an awesome goodie bag with exit care documents, extra bandages, and ointments for my burns (special thanks to Karen!). (Definitely call ahead to make sure that this is covered under your insurance as you should with any medical services).",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Jaidan Knights,"Ugh I want to like this place so bad. It's nice and clean on the inside so you have high expectations when you walk in. Granted, it's urgent care so you're most likely going to wait a while. That being said it took the front desk over an hour to get to my paper work, she was nice though. The copay is double what I've always paid at any other urgent care I've ever been to I'm not sure why this particular one is so much more expensive than every where else. The seats are good looking but easily the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in + sitting for almost 2 hours= not incredibly fun.  The people I saw in back were really nice, honestly I paid a fat co pay to find out that I'm just really sick but I have to come back if I stay sick and pay another huge co pay. So that's cool. But I guess knowing is better than not? I'm not sure I have mixed feelings about it. They ended up sending me a refund for the huge co pay that I paid which was super nice but also a little sketch about why I was charged so much to begin. I would come back though. Definitely one of the better urgent cares I've been to.",4,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Dakota Mac,"Golden Gate hires competent doctors and their front end representatives are kind enough. Â But don't let the facade lure you into what I can only describe as an unmitigated nightmare. Â Golden gates billing department is staffed by complete and utter morons who bill claims to the incorrect insurance agencies repeatedly. Â Instead of doing their do diligence, they bill you for the full cost of your visit without a second glance. Â Leaving their patrons responsible for calling them and waiting 45 minutes on hold to describe to a dotard that there are different insurance companies under the label California Blue Cross Blue Shield. Â While they take their time, needing multiple calls to correct billing, Â they will send multiple threatening bills. Â Take it from me. Â This is not the first, second or third time they have done this..... Â  it has been several. Â They are the most convenient urgent care to me, and I don't like giving bad reviews. Â But they are a business. Â There is no excuse for incompetence when billing. Â I will no longer patronize their business.

Tate Khan,"I HATE dealing with any sort of shot or needle. I have a history of fainting, so I was very nervous about it going into the Golden Gate Urgent Care to get a TB test. They were so unbelievably understanding. They let me lay down in one of the rooms after I got it so I had time to make sure I was ok and not going to faint in their waiting room! ha and all was well. Then when I came in to have the TB test area checked, for some reason that day I felt like I was going to faint, and the doctor checking me let me sit next to her chair in her office while they got me cold water and talked to me while I relaxed. I did not feel like I was being an inconvenience or anything. This is exactly the type of way I always want me nurses and doctors to act when I tell them I am not good with needles and need time after to relax. On top of that I never had to wait and I was a walk in. Awesome place!",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Iman Compton,"I had been to Goldengate urgent care once before a couple of years ago at their marina location. I found the care extraordinary and they took every caution making sure that I didn't have a more serious problem than I thought.Today was no exception, although I went to the west portal location. I've been having horrible stomach cramps that kept me up all night and I realized they weren't getting any better. I Â made an appointment for the market Street location, but received a text that they were running almost 2 hours late which meant I wouldn't be seen till way after my stated appointment. I called the West portal location and was told by the very helpful receptionist if I came in right now there was not much of a wait. So we took an Uber over there, and I found the check in process efficient and understanding given that I was in some serious pain.I only had to wait about 20 minutes to see Heidi the nurse, who was extremely compassionate and knowledgeable. She ran through all my vitals quickly, and made sure the doctor came in to see me as that by this time I was writing Â in serious pain. Dr. McIntyre was also compassionate, friendly, went through a number of questions identifying what the possibilities might be, conducted some tests and a physical exam and from those Â made his diagnosis.I was then discharged quickly with some medication, some information about possible future problems, and some advice about some over-the-counter meds I could purchase across the street at Walgreens. I can't tell you how thankful I am for both the nurse and the doctors care, compassion, and knowledge of situations like mine. Thanks Golden Gate Urgent Care - from the moment I entered to the time I was discharged I felt cared for and understood, and couldn't have asked for a better help to deal with my problem.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

The attendant threw a gown on the bed next to me telling me the doctor/ ""Provider"" Â might have to check me out. I was left alone for one hour in major pain until I finally stepped out to ask how long it was going to be because I had only put 2 hours on the street meter. Grudgingly another attendant looked at his computer and told me there was one other patient ahead of me. I went back in the waiting room and waited another 20 minutes. I got up and told the receptionist I wanted to cancel my appointment and provide me with proof of cancellation. While I was expressing my disappointment I watched a patient come out of a treatment room and she had already been seen by the doctor.

Everyone was friendly, and they moved me quickly from one person to the next (each having a different role). They all seemed to know exactly what to do. This should be a given, but when visiting a strange place with a huge wound, one never knows. I returned tonight to have my stitches removed. Once again, everyone with whom I spoke was knowledgeable and helpful. I did not get anyone's names, and I'm not sure it matters: They were all great and seem to work well together (so you should be in good hands with anyone), and I don't plan to be a regular (so I don't need their names). I said to one person, ""You are all so nice and competent!"" He replied, ""Well, we try to be nice, and we *should* be competent."" Indeed. It is so nice to see people who care doing their jobs well.

Alix Fields,"I have a terrific primary care physician, and his staff has been good about fitting me in with him or someone else in his practice when something is urgent. So I haven't had much experience with urgent care. I'd been seen at the UCSF Screening and Urgent Care Clinic many years ago, where the waits were long and the experience pretty bad.In this case, I had a problem in my foot that caused me such pain that it just wouldn't wait for my doctor's office to open on Monday; it was either this or the emergency room, and waiting for who knows how long. So based on Yelp reviews, I made an appointment online at Golden Gate Urgent Care in West Portal. The process of making the appointment was very easy, and I was seen within a reasonable period of time of my appointment. I was seen by Dr. McIntyre, who listened carefully (my medical problem was a recurrence of a problem I've had before) and prescribed the necessary meds.Best of all, they were able to dispense the meds. The copay was higher than if I'd taken a prescription to Walgreens, but the small difference was worth it not to have to make another stop while my foot was hurting like crazy. That made a really unpleasant day a little bit easier.I even got flu shot while I was there. I was glad they offered; I had forgotten it was that time of year again.I have an outstanding primary care physician, but it's nice to know that, on weekends or in the rare circumstance where I can't be seen there, I have an easy and high-quality alternative to going to the ER with something where the ER is overkill.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

GGUC had a page for online appointments so after a quick informative phone call I made an appointment for a couple hours later in the afternoon. I got a couple texts to inform me they were running behind (saving me time sitting in reception) and a third to inform me my appointment was in 30 minutes. Drove over, found parking fairly easily, and only sat in reception for about 10-20 minutes tops.A nurse did a strep swab and some diagnostics and then I waited maybe 10 minutes more for the doctor to arrive. Dr. Martin seemed very easy going and informed me my strep test was positive and prescribed me some antibiotics (which were reasonably priced and the expiration date was far in the future) as well as a steroid to help with the swelling. I asked her how much the steroid would cost (one time application in the clinic) and she didn't know so she opened the door and yelled over to the receptionist to ask how much it was. I thought this was more funny/bemusing than anything but it did make me glad that I hadn't gone in for anything embarrassing!

The quality of care given at this location is top notch and I would highly recommend this office anyone who needed a quick, unplanned doctor visit.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Lucca Shea,"Been here twice this year (feb and June)for a nasty flu. Wait was short, office was clean and staff was efficient. Both visits paid copay upfront.. Had no problem there until last week..I received a collections notice last week stating an amount owed on top of what I paid in office which is fine. Called their billing department to figure out why I was sent to collections and never received a single bill. The person I spoke to said they sent out multiple bills and that maybe it was my post office's problem that my mail never got to me. Really?? And yet the collection company was able to get their letter to me. Â At the end of the conversation, I read my address to her and once I got to the city and zip, she jumped in and said ""oh, that's why you're not receiving it, there was no city entered"". How does one even begin to send out a letter with no city entered? Maybe a courtesy call to confirm the address should have been made before sending my account to collections.",2,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Gia Barajas,"Another great experience at this clinic today. Made an appointment online, came in a little ahead of time, checked in, and was seen pretty close to my appointment time so minimal wait.

Aiden Alvarez,"Arrived just before their closing time on Saturday after 4 days in bed with the flu and a horrible cough that just wouldn't quit. I was a gross sick mess. I sensed if I waited any longer I'd likely end up in the ER, so asked my husband to bring me here instead. I'm so glad I did! Everyone from the front desk to the nurses to the doc who treated me (loved him- warm, funny, kind) were unbelievably kind and helpful. Not rushed at all, but also no long wait. Turns out I had pneumonia. They gave me a flu test, chest X-ray, and a breathing treatment immediately. They also had all the prescription meds I needed onsite which was beyond helpful. Thank you so much! Two days later and I'm feeling tons better!",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Haiden Stone,"I was given an appointment on the phone. The wait wasn't bad at all and I was treated with kindness. Â Dr. Don McIntyre was very personable and didn't rush.

Maddison Winter,"Both my husband and I have used the services at this West Portal SF location. The first time, we'd gone on a long walk in a wooded area and the next day I noticed a ""bite"" that was quite big and ugly on my husband's leg. Not sure if it was a tick, I decided to call and get him in to be seen. They had an appointment and we were able to get in quite promptly. The team that saw him gave him some ointment, said it would disappear in the next few days, but IF it got larger (they drew a circle around it) to please return. We were in and out quickly and they were very attentive and professional. The next time my husband lost his balance on a hill getting out of our car, picked up momentum and took a fall. Thankfully he did not hit his head, but as a precaution I wanted him checked out and just walked into this facility. They did a head scan and checked him out all over to make sure. Gave us the scan on a CD to show our doctor if needed and we felt relieved. The next time was MY turn. For several days I'd lost my voice and we were going on a trip, so I was concerned flying, etc. they gave me a powerful Rx to get filled and told me to rest my voice as much as possible, drink tea with honey and get sleep! Within a few days it was gone. So for the few times we've been in need, this has been great for us. A lot of people go to the ER when it's not necessary and you can go here! We have our Medicare, so it is far less expensive for them than the ER would be. We are covered fully, so it never costs us to go to Urgent Care. To us, the ER should be used for heart attacks, knifings, gunshot woulds and auto accidents, NOT typical daily issues! And often you don't need to ""run and see your doctor"" for some issues they can attend to here. We will continue to use this location whenever needed. The front desk staff has always been polite and the doctors very professional.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

The facilities are EXTREMELY clean, yet don't feel sterile, which is nice.Their receptionist, Monica, has been there every time I've come in. She never fails to make me laugh and take my mind off whatever is bothering me. She is a joy. There is also a very tall Asian male doctor who helped me this last time, who was both personable and informative.

Not only were the ladies at the front desk very friendly and helpful, they also made sure to check up on me while I was waiting to make sure I was doing ok (which was very thoughtful of them) . The doctor and nurses were also very welcoming and really listened to what I had to say about why I was visiting and what symptoms I was having. I appreciate that they took extra time to narrow in what might be the problem. Needless to say, I left very satisfied both visits.Also, I adore their waiting room ;) Very clean, beautiful, and nicely kept.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Hanan Mayer,"My first time ever using any type of urgent care so wasn't sure what to expect. Very much appreciated the modern and clean offices. 5 stars for this. Wish more medical facilities looked like this. I have to double on the other comments that there's no point in making an online appointment and then still have to wait behind everyone else who came in without an appointment. I had an acute case of sciatica, so waiting for over an hour despite having arrived on time for the booked time, wasn't fun. The actual consultation was a few minutes with a fairly stressed out doctor but maybe that's the nature of Â 'urgent care' which can't equal a visit with your general practitioner. Still great to have this service available in case of an emergency!",3,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care
Willow Mendoza,Today i just went to this urget care with my friend who got a big cut in his right hand they told us our insurance don't work so we decided to pay by our pocket but instead of doing the treatment they have given my friend the lot of paper work but he cannot do because he had a cut in the right hand and had a lot of blood and we waited like 20 minutes but no one is there to take care of his wound.

Â Even more important than that, the customer service and bedside manner of the staff is stellar. Â Finally, we have gotten very thorough, quality care from obviously skilled and compassionate providers. Â One last thing: I did have an issue at my last visit with getting a bill even though I had clearly paid, and when I mentioned it to the front desk staff Â (Hamed) tonight, he went well above and beyond to find out what might have happened and to help me resolve it.

Given that the alternative to urgent care used to be waiting in an ER, this service is special. I came here because I slammed my finger in a car door. It turned out that it was broken. This office normally works by appointments, but they gave be a proper ice pack and some Tylenol. If I had gone to an ER, I'm sure I would have been much lower on the triage list. I waited 40 minutes. Again, had I gone to an ER, I would have been triaged behind heart attacks and the like. My boyfriend came here. He had a flu that turned into pneumonia. He used the appointment system.

This might be due to the fact that they're new and not busy yet, but compared to my 4 hour wait at Concentra Urgent Care, this was golden. I also love the fact that they're open weekends and relatively late on weekdays. They even mentioned that if you arrive 1 minute prior to closing, they'll still gladly see you.The staff and NP here were all very friendly and helpful. The clinic is clean, modern, and spacious.

Lamar Li,Overall a positive visit. Their facility is clean. The staff were overall polite and professional. I was somewhat disappointed with my length of stay prior to being shown into the exam room which was approximately 10 to 15 minutes after my appointment time (I got there early enough to fill out the paperwork etc.) and also with the amount of time I had to wait once shown into the exam room. The rad tech who took my vitals and information was good; I forgot his name. Also the physicians assistant Shawna was professional and competent.,4,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Then Dr Martin, who is also great, professianal but human...the best !! thorough examination then diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Â We were told this coverage was accepted here. Â Five months later I got a bill for close to $500.00 saying he was not covered. Â Btw, payment needed to be paid within 5 days of receipt of this bill that I received on a Friday after work. Â On Monday I called my insurance company. Â The nice man I spoke with there got the billing department located in Southern California on the phone...a 3 way conversation. Â One half hour later the billing department seemed to understand how to complete the form correctly and how to send it to my insurance company. Â Well last night (Friday, November 20, 2015) I received a bill again...same bill, no coverage due on December 1, 2015. Â With the weekend and Thanksgiving holiday that gives me few days to get this to So Cal on time but first I will call again Monday morning because I know our coverage should take care of this.

I had intended to go to a hospital emergency room for my urgent problem, but took a chance on Golden Gate. What good fortune to find it, and to be seen by their head doctor, Kurt Kunzel MD. Rather than many hours waiting in an emergency room, I was seen by the doctor within a very few minutes.

Â What's the point of making an appointment if you don't see me during my appointment time and you also see walk-ins or people who don't make appointments before me? Â And making me wait an hour in a shut room is ridiculous and disrespectful.In all, the doctor saw me for 3 minutes and then a nurse handled the rest of my case. Â The doctor asked nothing extensive and asked me the same questions a nurse did.

Erin Cross,"giving ""health care"" a rating is hard, because working in the field of health care is so difficult. Â But some things are just not acceptable. but you can tell when a place is open just to make money vs really wanting to see patients and help people.Unacceptable items: 1. having to wait almost an hour with an appointment2. selling prescriptions when you don't have a pharmacy license3. attempting to sell expired medications4. brushing off a patient when they are talking to you and asking a valid question5. not facing a patient when they are talking to you6. talking about non-professional things where patients can hear everythingOn a Sunday morning I made an appointment on line for 10:30 and arrived more than on time. Â There were a lot of people ""signed in"" before me on the sheet, there is a space on there that indicates weather you have an appointment or not, Â but many Â of the people signed in before me indicated that they had an appointment and went in to see the doctor before me. Â So, I was a little frustrated that I did not get seen before those without an appointment. Â I didn't get seen until after 11:20 and then I still waited. The doctor comes in and barely does an assessment and was very quick with me. I didn't expect much based on the other yelp reviews that I read, and this is not my primary care office so I know she has no plan to get to know me. She then offers to ""SELL"" me the prescriptions for $20 each. Â I declined her offer because I have great insurance Â that coves prescriptionswhen I left the exam room the doctor was sitting at a computer and I brought to her attention that the number of days I needed to take the ear drops was not written on the prescription Â (which is required for the Rx to be a complete order) and I also asked why I needed to apply the ear drops in both ears if I have an infection in only one ear, and the doctor's response was ""the pharmacist will write all that out for you"". worst of all, she would not even turn around and face me to talk to me. I found it to be very very rude. Â She just resumes talking to the other workers about the Super Bowl and all her plans for the day.After I going to and calling 6 pharmacies in the area, 4 did not even sell the ear drops and the other Â 2 pharmacies had the ear drops for Â $65 (with my insurance) or $290 without. Â It really made me question how this urgent care could have the same ear drops for $20, if everyone else was selling them for much more. Â but I figured I would just go back there to buy themI returned the next day (Monday) and I told the receptionist that I was unable to get Â my prescription at a reasonable price and that I wanted to buy it there. Â She then starts talking to me about cough syrup, but I was there for ear drops. Â I asked her why they had a much lower price compared to the other places. Â She could not answer. Â She went into the back and I could hear her talking to the Doctor that saw me the day before. Â when she came back she stated that all the medication was expired and that she had nothing for me. I then asked her: ""so, yesterday they were going to sell me expired medications?"" her answer ""well, we don't really think that the medication expires on that date, its still good"". Â I was shocked!!!!  Â I told her I needed another ear drop prescription that I can take to the pharmacy, something more common. Â She went back and she came back with a paper and once again it did not have the number of days listed on the order. Â I asked if the doctor could write down the number of days (which is required for the Rx to be a complete order). Â Her answer was ""we can't help you with this anymore, you need to go to your primary care office or somewhere else"" Â I checked with the state, and they do not have a pharmacy license which is REQUIRED to sell any prescriptions. Â And they boast that they have Â UCAOA Accreditation. Â which is voluntary non required any urgent care can get this by just paying some money. It is not required and obviously doesn't insure quality of care or non expired medications, or correct prescription orders. Â  My experience was not good, and I would not recommend this place and I would not go back, ever.

Hudson Enriquez,"I gave a 1 star rating only because there is nothing less than 1 star. After my last visit at this Urgent Care I swore I would never go back, the Doctor who I had the pleasure of seeing told me ""I really need to get a primary care physician,"" which I have but it was after hours on a Friday night. Â He ended the visit by telling me I am either severely depressed, have a brain tumor or M.S. Â After a good chuckle, I made a promise I would never go back. Â Fast forward to today when my son playing on the playground caught his toe on a slide and received a pretty gnarly laceration. Â I didn't think it needed stitches but because it was received on a slide and promptly covered in sand I thought it should be looked at. Â So, against my better judgement we went returned to Golden Gate Urgent Care in West Portal, and before I was yelled at this time, I signed in as a walk-in on the iPad. Â It was very crowded but feeling confident that the reason the iPad is there is to help with registration, we sat down. Â We waited patiently as we watched his name move up the list and his wait times diminish. Â He got to the 0-20 minute wait and I waited for my name to be called to provide co-pay etc. Â Then the Â patient listed after him was called up and his name disappeared. Â I waited and asked why, and was told that they are getting a room ready so I sat back down. Â Then the nurse came and called the person who came in after us and again I went back up. Â ""ma'am your son did not disappear you will be called all is fine."" Then I hear a bit of chatter as the two women decide neither of them had checked us in and then they called me and started lecturing me on how to check in. Â I said I signed in on the iPad but she said that check in doesn't count and doesn't trigger any notification that we are there. Â THEN WHY IS IT THERE?!?! Â I tried to talk to her, as her voice elevated higher and higher and she ended by telling me ""that is how a doctor's office works, you check in."" Well we checked out for the last time and went to the ER at CPMC, we were treated like humans, my co-pay wasn't that much more than what GGUC charges, we received great care and my son waited all of about 5 minutes to be seen by someone who knows what she is talking about.

Mallory Hart,"I usually don't post on yelp but after my experience here at Golden Gate Urgent Care, I felt the need to share my experience with other potential patients as well as the business owner. I came in at 7:20 so that I could be seen by a physician as soon as possible. Considering the place opens at 7:00 am. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was an empty lobby with one employee working behind the counter. I believe her name was Ronnie. I don't know if I caught her at a bad time or if it was early, but her attitude was terrible to say the least. I had a few questions regarding some information on my prescription and the way she talked to me made me feel belittled. Running a business, the owners as well as the staff should have the customers best interest in mind and should have an ultimate goal of making them feel better when they leave their establishment. This was not the case. If anything I felt worse than when I came in. The only good part of the experience was talking with the doctor. She was really helpful and sincere with my problems.

Lynn Estrada,"It's better to just go either to your regular hospital's ER or at least some ER rather than here unless it's for an extremely minor issue. Â At least at the ER one will be sure that one will be seen. Â Although we were told on the phone that this urgent care facility does treat pneumonia it actually depends on how the severity of the patient's symptoms. Â In my mother's case, however, they determined that due to her vitals showing low oxygen levels that they could not/would not even treat at all. From that point it was if she were a pariah. Â Thus, the doctor on duty burst into the exam room, alarmingly told us that he'd be ordering an ambulance immediately to take my mother to whichever hospital's ER we chose. Â He was very adamant that we leave their facility immediately. Needless to say it was very abrupt as we definitely got the message: Â My mother was a huge liability being on their premises. Â We could have just driven to our regular hospital's ER instead of wasting time at the urgent care facility had we realized it would be useless to take her there; we could have saved ourselves embarrassment too. Â Instead of my mother being treated we were all now the focus of everyone's attention from the gawking waiting patients in their lobby to the passersby on the sidewalk. Â My mother was ushered out on the stretcher in full view of everybody with us in tow. Â Thankfully the EMT's were two of the best ever.UPDATE: Â So the moron who is rating all the negative reviews with a ""Funny"" rating must work here. Â So sad that so-called professionals actually have childish attitudes and cannot accept criticisms.And most importantly: Â Go straight away to the nearest Emergency Department rather than to waste precious time at this (or any other) urgent care facility.

The service was great and everyone was really nice (to me personally). I didn't give them 5 stars because I heard the people working there talking about me, while I was waiting in my examination room (with the door shut) and they were outside. One woman asked another for my name, then my height (5'5""), then my weight (100 lbs), and the other woman answered and then joked that my bmi was 4 and then they laughed.

Convenience was awesome because although they had my medication ready on site, there's also a walgreens right across the street. Cons of this place were the lack of people, pretty awkward getting such good service by yourself.

Gurpreet Vance,"I have been a customer of West Portal GGUC for the last 4 years and I like their personnel very much, but this review is not about their personnel at all. I had the issue with GGUC Billing Department last year and it took 6 months and extensive efforts on my side to get my money back. That episode did not make me feel good about their relationship with their customers/patients. I was ready to give GGUC a second chance since I like their doctors and went to their office this Monday, registered as a walk in like always and waited patiently to give my information and pay at the registration desk just to find out from the office screen that my estimated wait time is between 6h 30 min to 6h 45 min. Gentlemen before me asked the same question and walked out. Â I was shocked by the wait time-higher than regular ER, and left the office. On the way home I drove by Dignity Urgent Care, decided to give it a try and was in and out of the office in 20 min with all lab work done and my prescriptions in my pharmacy! Wow! That was a new shocker! I was used to waiting of about 30-50 min in the waiting room of GGUC (apart from this Monday's experience), than another 30-40 min for the Dr's arrival after the nurse checks my vitals and another 10-15 min for my prescriptions after all. I have realized that all this time I could have chosen other practice where my 2h of life would not be spent in waiting. I wrongly assumed that the amount of time I spent waiting was more or less the same in every urgent care. I was so wrong. I have learned my lesson and will not repeat it. It is not ok to have your patients wait in the waiting room sick and infectious for hours. And I had occasions when I would register online, schedule my appointment, show up on time for it just to find myself waiting again those 30-40 min (so decided to stop registering online). Taking into the consideration my new knowledge of efficiently run services GGUC is not anymore on the top of my to go list when I seek medical help.",1,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Rhian Avalos,"Beautiful, clean place. I came here when I accidentally (and stupidly) sliced my thumb with a very sharp knife while washing the dishes. I didn't have insurance, so I avoided the emergency room, hoping to save $. Not a lot of people were in when I got there and Ken immediately attended to me. I was panicking and nervous, but he did his best to keep the mood light and it definitely helped me relax. I was then checked by Dr. Martin, who was very sweet and reassuring the entire time. I ended up getting stitches, which sucked, but I really felt cared for and in good hands. I was afraid I'd have to pay close to $1,000 for everything, but only ended up paying less than $400. Not too bad for someone without insurance who had to get stitches done! I was very satisfied and impressed with the service and the entire establishment in general.

My coughing got so bad, I remembered seeing this facility and I called. There were no more appointments, just walk ins. I walked in at about 5:10pm.

It wasn't until I insisted that I spoke with my insurance company and I was told I could come to there facility and it would be covered.

Ray Armitage,"Would be one star, if not for the receptionists--I went in with a broken tooth and jaw swelling, which I knew was the cause of my pain. At the moment, I'm two weeks from potentially getting hired fulltime at a new job with insurance, but until then, I literally cannot afford to take days off (it will hurt my chances of getting hired). So, I went in, hoping to get checked out and get some antibiotics to hold it off until I can actually get into a dentist. About fifteen minutes after checking in, the receptionist told me the doctor wanted to do a quick examination to see if she could even treat me before they charged me. The doctor in question was very brusque, and poked and prodded the swollen area in a way that took the pain up from a 6 to a 10, before dismissing me and telling me she wasn't going to treat me. When I asked if I could at least get examined to get a prescription for antibiotics to provide some relief until I could get into a dentist, she still refused, insisting that she wasn't going to do anything for me, and that I would need to go the SF General's clinic for treatment. She examined me just around the corner of the reception desk with next to no privacy, which was bad practice. Ultimately, the receptionists gave me both the card to their personal dentist that took care of emergencies, and directions to SF General, where they treated me without question (although they're just as confused as to why she even refused to give me an antibiotic prescription).",2,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Parker Barry,"I am posting here the review I wrote for the Market Street Golden Gate Urgent Care. West Portal gets five stars because they fixed a mess that Market Street made. From appointment to getting stitches removed, the entire staff here was compassionate and helpful, the whole process (appointments, check in, etc.) was great, and the care was excellent. I would absolutely recommend coming here if you have medical care that does not require a visit to the ER, but does require medical attention. If you want to know why I am recommending this place, read on. This is what happened at Golden Gate Urgent Care Market Street:I cut the inside of my thumb at the joint finger pretty badly on a Friday afternoon. Not wanting to sit in an ER for what was sure to be several hours, I decided to give one of these Urgent Care facilities a try. Golden Gate on Market Street was not far from our home, so we made an appointment (very convenient) and went down at the appointed time. The check in was easy. They took my insurance, estimated the cost, and asked for payment, which I made with a credit card. The chart that lets you know how long you have to wait meant you didn't have to sit there and wonder when you'd get in, wait the requisite polite time before you go ask the person at the front desk, etc. was great. When it was my turn, I went in, they did the check, cleaned the wound, etc., and then said my options were stitches or glue. The PA working on me said stitches are painful so he only recommended them for someone like a fulltime mother with three who's running around doing a lot of different things. I told him what my day looks like, including riding a bike to get around the city amongst other things. He said the glue would be just fine. I left about 45 minutes later with my finger glued. In about two hours, the glue had ripped and my finger was bleeding. By the next morning, it was a bleeding oozing mess. I called Golden Gate on Market and they were not really interested in helping me. When I insisted, I was put on hold until someone else came on the phone and said in an, ""if we must"" tone of voice that I could come down and they would re-glue the finger; it was too late for stitches. I asked if they could make an exception because the glue would not hold, and I was firmly told no. So then I asked, ""What is the plan when the glue rips again?"" Their response? ""Well I guess you'll have to come back and we can glue it again or put Steri Strips on it."" So here I am, bleeding finger, $180 lighter in the pocket, and dealing with this ""don't bother us attitude."" There was no way I was going back to a facility where I am marked as the difficult person making unreasonable requests. So hoping for a better outcome, and desperate, I made an appointment with the West Portal Golden Gate Urgent Care, and then I called them. I was lucky enough to get one of the nurse managers who was very nice, compassionate, and apologetic over my experience. She saw we had an appointment and said definitely come in, they could take a look and sort me out, and also she would note the account not to charge us. I had no objection to being charged again. I had insurance and they were going to have to do something to fix this mess. But she insisted. Fine. Once in the exam room, the nurse manager checked my thumb and agreed it was a mess, then the doctor checked it and concurred. The doctor said even though they don't usually do stitches after 24 hours, it was okay to do on a finger (and it was only about 28 hours since I gut it), and she would do it in this case because the finger would not heal otherwise. So, moving on, they removed as much of the glue as they could and cleaned the wound (OUCH), and then the doctor stitched the finger (more OUCH). I left with excellent instructions and all went well. I returned in 10 days to have the stitches removed. When I heard it was a PA doing it, I was concerned given my last experience with the Market Street PA who was either not interested in stitching, or not competent enough to see that only stitches would work. I was told this PA was excellent and I needed the stitches removed, so I went for it. The first thing she asked was what happened, and the second thing she asked was who glued it because she never would have glued this cut! So stitches removed. Ugly lumpy scar in place because of the delay with stitching, but finger is working again, I'm not a hand model, and the West Portal Team was great. Then I receive my EOB and discovered I only owed $98 dollars. Â So naturally, I expected a refund. What did I get instead? An unauthorized charge on my credit card, 25 days later. 15 minutes later I'm told that there is an overage and finance would review. The same lackadaisical attitude I received at Market Street. Hmm, you screwed up my care, you owe me money, you charge me more, and you know all of this but you'll just take it to finance for review. Not good.",5,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Brittany Whitley,"Where do I even begin? I was in SF last night to visit my dear friend that lives around the corner from this urgent care and attend my husbands company holiday party. After the party and while walking on Embarcadero, I fell really hard and landed right on my left patella. I had never been in so much pain in my life (and I've had 2 kids and c-sections). My husband had to carry me to get to a car so we could be seen at this facility since it was so close to where we were staying. I was the last patient of the day when I arrived. The receptionist (unfortunately I didn't catch her name) was so sweet and she got me an ice pack for my injury. I was called back within a few minutes and assisted by Ken. He was so nice and caring and then Amy arrived to administer more care. Between administering pain meds, x-rays and wrapping my knee, cleaning it, immobilizing it I was in and out of there in 30min or so. But, I felt so cared for and that I was in great hands. It's unfortunate that they closed as early as they did today because my friend needed an urgent care and was going to go to this location based on their treatment for me last night. I won't post a picture of how horrific my knee injury looks, hopefully I won't need surgery, but the staff here made sure I was well taken care of for the weekend until I can get I to see an ortho specialist.

Celyn Davison,"I came here about 2 weeks ago with horrible flu like symptoms. I was so sick I ended up fainting in the waiting room so of course was seen right away, which was probably the only positive thing about this visit. I was rushed to back and right away. Since I had been so sick an they figured I was dehydrated so they decided to give me a I.V. But is wasn't that simple after about 2 different people trying, and being poked about 5 times they had to call in a 3rd person to find a vein to put in the i.v, finally they got it in. After one bag they checked my vitals and decided I needed a second bag. During this time they never once did any blood work, my fever was going up, and my vitals were not normal. After the second bag my vein had collapsed so once again it took 3 people being poked multiple times to find a vein, but this time when they grabbed my armed they pulled it in the wrong direction over the bed twisted is and caused a excruciating pain and discomfort. ( 2 weeks later i am still dealing with the pain and can barely lift and move my arm normally). So now I am on my 3rd bag of fluids, still no blood work done, still can't figure out what is wrong with me, and now everything is getting worse and my fever is rising. After the 3rd bag they now decide I just have a stomach Virus, and decide to give me a 4th bag of fluids. I have now been here for 8 hours. I am exhausted at this point i am in pain and swollen from all the fluids being pumped in me. After the 4th bag is finished they check my temperature and vitals. I now have fever of 104! They debate about giving me a 5th bag but decide they are also all to tired and want to go home so they give me some nausea medicine tell and release me. The next morning I wake up and I can't breath, i am so swollen and in so much pain I have to call a ambulance and am rushed to the e.r and find out i had way more than a stomach virus and that I had strep in my blood, i was rushed to icu and even put on a ventilator. This urgent care could of cost me my life. No tests or blood work were ran. they just assumed. If they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me they should of relased me sooner and told me to go to the e.r instead of just playing the guessing game. I am very upset with the care i was given here. I also felt as if they were getting upset and frustrated with me because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and it made me feel uncomfortable as if i was a burden to be there. I will deff never be back here.",1,Dignity Health- GoHealth Urgent Care,Urgent Care

Kaylen Humphreys,"I would highly recommend that you do not go to this location unless you absolutely, absolutely have to. I have visited them three times now for unrelated issues and each time I left Â untreated. The first time, I was given Â antibiotics for what turned out to be a VIRAL infection (meaning the medication was of absolutely no use to me because viruses cannot be treated this way). The second time, I received a numbing shot to ""drain"" an infection on my finger--which actually ended up SPREADING my infection across my finger, because again, viral infections, shouldn't be treated this way--you would think a physician would know this--my doctor literally went on google to find out what infection I was experiencing. How comforting is that?? And the third time I was given eye drops for ""pink eye"" for what turned out to be an eye stye. The doctors here are inexperienced and sloppy (at best) in their diagnosis of their patients. Everyone is friendly but I am incredibly unhappy about feeling like I am dealing with professionals who pretend to know what they are talking about when they truly have no idea. I have come here as this location is close to my home, but I will not be doing it any longer. I urge you to find another location to avoid spending any kind of money on insufficient health service!!

Tai Hayes,"I called the office and was given an appointment for 12:50. I arrived there around 12:35, checked-in, filled out the paper work and took a seat in the waiting room. I was finally shown in to a room at 1:30 where the nurse took my vitals and went on to inform me that it would be another 20-30 mins before the MD would show up. I was appalled as that would imply a 1 hour wait past my appointment time. I waited and waited till 2:15 at which point I lost my patience and had to threaten to leave. The MD finally came to see me at 2:30 (1hr and 40 mins after my appointment time) and was very apologetic and went on to tell me that they were severely understaffed. I do not blame him and was actually very satisfied with his examination. On the other hand, I do blame the owners who have instituted a system of bringing in patients but not staffing to appropriately attend to them.

Frankie Chambers,"I just became a patient here after leaving Kaiser (who I was with since 2007) and so far it's one of the best decisions I ever made. Â NP McCloud is the opposite of most modern Drs; he really listens, is honest and straightforward while also being caring and respectful, takes his time to get to know you and let you know him, and treats you like a relative equal--he doesn't have that ""Drs disease"" of ego and dismissive omniscience that I've run into so often (and especially at Kaiser). Â I am one of those patients who knows my shit, and I have run into so many situations with Drs where I have to feign ignorance and flatter their egos in order to get the best treatment--not so with McCloud. Â I felt like my input and knowledge of my own body, my own conditions and treatment options, were not only listened to but respected and considered. Â Unlike at Kaiser of course NP McCloud and Dr Hassler are free to practice without being beholden to Kaisers one-size-fits-all (and not very well) standards of care, which means they can start to effectively treat conditions that appear *before* they get severe--something that Kaiser for all it's big talk about preventative medicine will not do. Â McCloud and staff will work as advocates with your insurance company to make sure you get coverage for the right medications or equipment. Â  Even if you're not coming from a terrible practice like I am, these guys still stand far out from the average in their attitude and approach. Â I'm still in the very beginning of my relationship with this practice and decades of dealing with crap doctors still leaves me wary, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Vivian Munro,"I would love to give this place 5 stars and probably would have if I had not met the nutritionist.I was experiencing constant headaches and hadn't yet chosen a primary doctor so, after reading Yelp reviews, I called this place. Â The receptionist explained that new patient visits with the doctor usually requires a month or more advance booking so, since I was in need of seeing someone ASAP, she would make an appointment with the P.A. instead. I saw Aaron McCloud who I adored (10 stars for him!). Â At first, I was scared to be examined by him because he's so clean and perfect looking (stylish clothing with perfectly polished shoes and neat hair) that I really didn't want him looking up my nostrils and into my ears since I'm sure I'm not as meticulous about up-keeping those areas as I would imagine him to be. Â But Aaron was so warm, friendly, and so easy to talk to that I quickly overcame any fear of being cruelly judged by him.So he examined me and concluded that the headaches were the result of smoke inhalation. Â He then checked to see if I had any other concerns. Â I did and after he addressed them, he recommended that I speak with the nutritionist, Margaret Davis. Â My consultation with Aaron was the most thorough and informative medical visit I ever had so I couldn't wait to meet Â Margaret. Â This is where things went down hill. Â I met with Margaret the next day. Â Margaret was the opposite of Aaron in appearance and attitude. Â She was impersonal, stand-offish &amp; just plain uncomfortable to be around. Â She told me that it was not her job to work with me on my binge eating (something I specifically came to her about). Â Instead, she suggested that I work with a therapist and proceeded to recommend a generic (pamphlet ready!) diet plan that consisted of 3 square meals a day.What a load of baloney! Â First of all, I know that my binging is emotionally linked because I didn't start doing it until my mother (who has since passed) became terminally ill. Â So yes, I understood the importance of going to counseling to help me with my binging but she, a NUTRITIONIST, didn't feel that she should be addressing that issue whatsoever? Â She, a NUTRITIONIST, believes she can come up with an adequate diet plan to help me with my weight loss while refusing to address the issue that caused the weight gain to begin with? Â She, a NUTRITIONIST, didn't understand that because I've been a size 5 since I was 16 years old that my normal diet is probably not the problem and maybe my binge eating which began shortly before I stated gaining weight, may be the only issue that a nutritionist could address that might be of assistance to me. Â Really? Â I didn't expect her to get behind my emotional issues but I did expect some good, solid advice that addressed the issue that I was facing. Â Tell me methods I could use to help catch myself before binging! Â Tell me whether I should or should not avoid the types of foods that I tend to binge on! Â Let me know of ways that helped other clients avoid binging! Â Tell me ANYTHING that addresses the issue that caused me to NEED a nutritionist in the first place but don't dismiss the problem so that you can discuss your generic, useless plan that you had ready for me before you even sat down to talk to me. Â . Â What a load of baloney and waste of time . . .Final rating: Â go for the awesome P.A's and front desk staff but if you need help with weight loss and believe you might have difficulty controlling your eating or that you may have an obsession with controlling your eating, skip the nutritionist and consider one of these free support groups (which offer practical tips and advice in addition to support) instead:foodaddicts.orgfoodaddictsanonymous.orgBTW, my GYNECOLOGIST referred me to these organizations because, apparently, gynecologists are more well versed on binge eating than nutritionists are.

Roan Cope,"Parents, or soon-to-be parents, if you are considering Getzwell Pediatrics, let me tell you this wholeheartedly: joining Getzwell has been one of the best decisions we have made as parents. We have been a part of the practice for almost 5 years, and we have 2 girls. Before joining Getzwell we were part of another pediatric practice when our first baby was a newborn, and let me tell you the outstanding differences between Getzwell and most of other pediatric practices:1. If you need to help after hours or on weekends you can call and take directly to a provider. I didn't really understand how incredible this was until we needed it. Most other practices have you talk to an advice nurse hotline, which is helpful, but they can not diagnose or prescribe anything. Talking directly to a provider can save hours of waiting in a crowded urgent care clinic. 2. All 4 providers are exceptional. We have seen both Dr. Getzelman and Dr. Glynn, as well as both nurse practitioners Alexa and Rachel. All are excellent! They go above and beyond. Dr. Glynn took the time to email me some ear oil recipes for my daughters ear infection after I spoke with her on the phone. Alexa let me email her photos of my daughters rash over the weekend to make sure that the medicine was working. Dr. Getzelman took the time to email me some supplements she recommended for me personally even though I'm not a patient. Rachel has taken my call after hours and she is equally patient, kind, and very sharp. 3. You get an hour for well child appointments. This is amazing!! Most practices the providers are rushing in and out and don't have much time for questions- but here, you have plenty of time to ask about anything related to your child's health.4. No crowded waiting rooms. Have you never had to sit in a waiting room with coughing kids, runny noses and crying babies? Trust me, it can be really hard. At Getzwell they get you right in at your appointment time- I've never waited in the waiting room with anyone else. My only wish is that I could be a patient here too! Getzwell is truly outstanding. If you schedule a consultation appointment you will get a chance to see for yourself how great it is.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"

Tyrell Reese,"When my son was first born, we wanted to check out several different approaches to pediatrics to see what would be the best fit for our family. We took him to newborn checkups and normal exams at both GetzWell and a more traditional practice. At first, the biggest difference was the time in the room with the doctor. At the more traditional practice, the visit were exactly 15 minutes, my son was weighed/measured and we talked through ""concerns"" only. At GetzWell, we spent 45 minutes discussing everything from what the best diet was for infants to what types of activities would help him thrive. It felt so much more comprehensive.My son got the flu on New Years day, a very inconvenient day to need to get a hold of a doctor. He was weak, had a very high fever and was only 8 weeks old. We called the nurse line at the more traditional practice and ended up waiting hours for a response, and when the response came it was a generic ""go to the closest hospital"", and there was no real follow up. With GetzWell we were on the phone with an actual doctor from the practice within 10 minutes. She talked over all of his symptoms and we made a plan to drive to UCSF. She was texting with us through the rest of the night and scheduled an in person follow up with us for the next day. We felt like we had a partner in a very scary situation and knew that that type of partnership is exactly what feels right for our family pediatrician.We have been with Getzwell every since.

Aman Newman,"We are a very happy family who have been with Getzwell for 2 years since moving to the Bay Area. Finding a first rate pediatrician was of top priority for us. As my husband is in natural health products (from a more holistic approach) and I grew up with an MD father, we knew we were looking for a special type of practice. How lucky we were to learn that Getzwell was right in our neighborhood and practices medicine in what I like to think is the ""old fashioned, patient focused"" way. From well-baby visits, to routine follow-ups, we get first class care anytime we need it. It's about as good as having a physician in the family, after-hours messages are returned promptly and follow-ups from the physicians after visits are routine and help to put anyone at ease. We never have to wait in the waiting room when we are there, and my son actually enjoys his visits (even when he gets vaccines). Aside from the pediatricians who are amazing, the nurse practitioner was incredibly thoughtful and thorough for the visit we had with her, and the staff are always so professional and positive both in person and on the phone. The pediatricians are always willing to work with us to achieve our health goals with our son in the ways that we are comfortable with and are happy to answer questions and advise us where we feel we can use a little extra information. If anyone is looking for a truly superb practice, I would never hesitate to recommend Getzwell pediatrics. N.B. I know there is one review that mentions that the practice is out of network or isn't covered by insurance. While the practice does not take insurance, they do help you file insurance claims to your insurance carrier should you be uncomfortable or unable to do so yourself. I had issues with my first attempts at filing claims, and after a year of un-filed claims (and having reached my deductible), I finally asked for their assistance in filing claims. While they charge a fee per claim filed, not having to do so myself (knowing now I don't often get around to it with my busy pace life) is a real relief. Yes, insurance makes me pay the lions share my own, but I believe it is well worth it. I pay for out of network physicians and procedures myself when I need them with top specialists, why wouldn't I be willing to do so myself for my child to ensure he has the best access to care?",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Siobhan Austin,"We have been with Getzwell for about 8 years and since our son was born and our daughter was a toddler. Â We originally switched to the practice to try their whole-health approach to treat our daughter's asthma.

Â Our daughter eventually has outgrown the asthma and we feel Getzwell helped tremendously through those difficult times.We moved to Marin and we still come to SF to see Dr G. Â We have considered switching to a local practice but have chosen not to because of the level of service and quality that we get at Getzwell. Â First, they really know our kids and all of their issues throughout the years. Â Second, they always (always!) provide ample time for an appointment and listen to all the questions. Â Third, they are available to respond via email when necessary. Â Fourth, when calling during off hours you will talk with one of the people from the practice (often it will be Dr G herself.) Â Fifth, they will discuss all of the things that are a part of a growing child -- emotional well being, behavioral issues, social issues, and the usual milestone markers for learning as well as physical development.

The time and attention spent with us and our daughter was a level above any care we have received before. I highly suggest looking into this practice for your family.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Shelby Howells,"I rarely write reviews, but i feel compelled to do so for Getzwell Pediatrics, Dr. Getzelman and the entire team. Â This is what a real doctor's office should base their fundamentals of their practice on: treating a child when he's sick. Â Seems simple but that's the difference between this Â practice and the other pediatric practices.I found Getzwell as I had just moved back into the city - and my son went faint for a moment. Â I panicked and called the pediatric doctor's office which had seen my son fro birth to 12 months - they told me they were booked with appointments and there was no way i could see or even speak to a doctor! Â They told me I could make an appointment for 3 days later - but i knew my son needed to see a doctor right away. Â The only option they gave me was to go to the clinic at UCSF - but I had to wait 4 hours until it opened at 5:30pm! Â What doctor has office policies like that! Â I called other pediatricians, but they flatly turned me away as they didn't want to see new patients.I found Getzwell and called them - they immediately listened to the medical issues i was having with my son, and then asked me to hold so they could speak to the Pediatrician on duty - whom happened to be Dr. Getzelman. Â They said that the doctor would stay late for me, and to bring my son in right away.Even though I was not a member (at that moment) and have never seen this doctor - Dr. Getzelman most important issue was the health safety of my son. Â And that is priceless. Â So I signed up right away - it's worth every penny to have someone actually care about your child as if they are your own. Â When I call with issues - i speak with a doctor. Â After-hours, i speak with a doctor. Â It's like having a friend who is a pediatrician. Â Only issue is how am I going to get them to take me as a patient??? Â LOLNow, 3 years later, every visit is a pleasure - and my son LOVES all of the doctors. Â This is the way it should be.BEST DECISION I MADE WAS JOINING GETZWELL!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Maya Burgess,"Dr. Getzelman and her staff are nothing short of excellent Â My entire team has relocated here from NYC and GetzWell Pediatrics is the only pediatrician I recommend (hence my duly post here!). They are best in class in all that matters: wholistic view on health and well-being for our little ones (read: not quick to jump on antibiotics or any other quick-fix), uber responsive (read: live doctor available any/every hour), and personalized. As our expectations as parents grows and healthcare advances, GetzWell continues to deliver. I also love and value the team's commitment to learn and grow (from industry conferences, to tailored offerings on the latest medical advances). I truly cannot recommend this stellar team enough. Thank You for all that we know you do, and for all that we will never know you do for your patients' extraordinary care!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Luna Madden,"I can't rave about Julia Getzelman and her staff enough. She addresses the WHOLE person; she doesn't just look at symptoms and treat them, she looks at the entire system of a family to ensure balance and well being. I have had her as our pediatrician for both of my children, now 10 and 5 years, with since birth and we couldn't be happier. Julia is brilliant, kind, loving and funny and is always in search of a better question about what's going on. Her and her team's guidance, support and care has been more than we could ask for in a pediatrician's office. (Everyone that works there in the office is superb.) If you want exceptional peace of mind knowing you have a partner when it comes to all things health, you must consider her and her team. You will be so glad you did!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Keanu Jefferson,"I grew up in SF and used to go to Getzwell. When I was in town recently and thought I might have strep throat I called the office to see where they would suggest I go. I was surprised when they said they'd be able to see me 2 hours later at their Union Street office. I ended up seeing Dr. Glynn who actually remembered me, and she sent my prescription in electronically so that it was ready when I got to the pharmacy. I really appreciated their flexibility and willingness to help me out when I was sick!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Saba Singh,"We have been with GetzWell for over 2 years now and could not be happier with our choice. Â Dr. Getzelman is attentive, knowledgeable and a great person to have parenting discussions with. Â The level of care and scope of services she provides is truly above and beyond. Â We are first time parents and acknowledge we may be overly anxious at times, so we appreciate that we never feel rushed and always feel heard. Â GetzWell gives us the peace of mind in knowing we can reach a competent doctor or nurse practitioner at any time of day. Â There is also huge value in a doctor who personally knows your child and his/her history.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Ashleigh Mercado,"My family and I have been going to Getzwell for over 2 years now and we still couldn't be happier. We were especially excited when they opened their second office on Union Street because it's closer to us and very easy to get to. Â The new office is just as warm and welcoming as their Noe Valley location. And the staff there is amazing - we're very happy with Dr. Glynn, her caring and compassionate nature made the transition to the new office seamless and enjoyable!Getzwell is an absolute godsend. They really are the best pediatric practice around, far exceeding what we could have hoped for in a pediatrician. They have created a space where families feel welcome, both physically and emotionally. We have always been treated with respect and warmth, and our opinions are not only tolerated but invited. I have always been supported in my beliefs, and thanks to their longer appointments, each physician offers ample time for dialogue and exploration, questions and concerns. I know that my kids are healthier because of the care they've gotten and the guidance we as parents have received from them.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Jorgie Edwards,"My two kids who are now teenagers have been patients of Dr. Getzelman's for almost 10 years. I switched to the practice when I felt that traditional approaches were too harsh and not meeting my kids' needs. Â We have been extremely happy with the practice, and Dr. Getzelman in particular. She has developed a great rapport with the kids over the years and they trust her and feel comfortable with her as they grow older and their bodies are changing, and as they are more interested in their health and wellness. It's worth highlighting that Dr. Getzelman's unique knowledge, approach and experience is exceptional, and she has single-handedly managed to help my ADHD child become ""non-symptomatic."" Through a process of various specialized and cutting-edge tests, Dr. Getzelman was able to pin-point my child's genetic disparities which were causing ADHD behaviors and symptoms. With an elaborate course of supplements (and not medications), overnight my child was able to focus, sit still, and manage impulses. It was remarkable, absolutely unbelievable. It has made a huge difference at school and at home. More importantly, my child is now healthy, and no other doctor or method of diagnosis would have provided or allowed us the (terrifying) insight that his brain was suffering from an autoimmune attack, which was causing the ADHD symptoms.Dr. Getzelman is well connected in so many alternative communities, for those who like to seek out alternative treatments. She has introduced us to many practitioners in SF (osteopaths, homeopaths, acupuncturists, etc.) that have helped to keep my kids (and me) healthy and thriving. Â She's also well-versed and current re the most effective brands and products. She's reachable, responsive, concerned, and compassionate. Dr. Getzelman is a rare find and my family is grateful she's located in SF!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Cory Mahoney,"We had the pleasure of working with Dr. Sheibani during the first few months after our daughter was born. She was the doctor who did our newborn housecall, and the one we saw for our initial doctor visits. We had some feeding issues in the early weeks, and Dr. Sheibani went out of her way to help us with them - she even made phone calls to us in her car on her way home from work! Her advice came not only from medical knowledge, but also personal experience, which made her very relatable. Each time we met with her, we felt like family.Unfortunately for us, Dr. Sheibani has reduced her time at Getzwell while she pursues another area of pediatric medicine. Last we heard, she was filling in on occasion in the Noe office. If you have the opportunity to meet with her, take it! Although, you really can't go wrong with anyone you see at Getzwell. All the doctors and nurses that we've met with have a refreshingly holistic view to childhood health.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Diya Schofield,"Summary: Â Terrible service and sub par care provided by nice people in a clean office that costs a small fortune and is always out of network. Â Our full experience below.After reading their reviews their practice seemed to check all the boxes we wanted including a more holistic approach to medicine and vaccines.We scheduled our first appointment 3 days after bringing our son home. Â We had hoped to have him seen a day earlier. Â I asked if we could bring him to their offices, but we were told that the first visit was ALWAYS an in home visit. Â That was fine with my wife since she was still recovering from the c-section. Â A day before the scheduled appointment we were told that one of the new born screenings had come back positive for a rare metabolic disorder (citruline transcarbamylase deficiency). Â The physical symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, unresponsiveness and lack of appetite. Â Our baby had NONE of these symptoms. Â Regardless, we were told that we must get blood work done immediately. Â We rushed our newborn to the lab at 7AM the next morning (for an ammonia test). Â This was not a simple heel prick. Â The lab had to draw blood intravenously. Â  By the time we got home from the lab (around 10AM) we had received another email from Getzwell saying that the original lab slip was incomplete and we needed to have more blood tests done. Â I was furious and spoke with the nurse practitioner from Getzwell. Â I was told that these instructions were coming from the metabolic specialists at UCSF and this was their protocol. Â If it was protocol you would think that the battery of tests would be standardized. Â We were told (again) that we needed to get these other tests done ASAP. Â We were scheduled to see Dr. Glynn later that afternoon and since our son showed none of the physical symptoms we decided to wait on the extra blood work to see what she thought we should do after looking him over. Â Dr. Glynn completed her evaluation and said that he looked pretty good (still had a little jaundice), but his weight could be a little low. Â She told us that his ammonia test came back perfectly normal, but we still had to go get the other blood work done. Â She said that we could possibly wait a day to do it, but that we still needed to get it done. Â She also said that we needed to bring him in the following day to get weighed to make sure he was gaining weight. Â While our baby seemed to be in good health it was tough to hear that we needed to bring him back in for more blood work. Â We scheduled the follow up appointment for the following morning at their office on Union St. and would head over to the lab if necessary afterwards (we were hoping to be told that we did not need the additional tests done). Â We saw Dr. Getzelman the next morning. Â She weighed him and that was it. Â He had gained 0.2 ounces over 18 hours! Â Great news, although it did seem kind of arbitrary since none of us knew if he needed to pee or poop and Dr. Getzelman never asked us when or how much his last feeding had been. Â We then asked her about the additional labs and if they were truly necessary. Â She said they were necessary even though our son showed no signs of the disorder. Â I asked her to call the specialists at UCSF to make sure that we weren't missing anything. Â She tried calling but said that she couldn't get ahold of anyone (it was 10:00AM on Thursday). Â She also couldn't tell us anything about the disorder and what that would potentially mean for our son if he did have it. Â We knew as much as she seemed to after doing a days worth of internet research. Â We headed back to the lab for another excruciating experience.The next day we hoped to hear from Getzwell regarding the lab results. Â No lab results, but we did receive receipts for the in home visit, follow up appointment and membership fee. Â $780 for the in home visit! Â $280 for the follow up visit (weighing only)! Â $310 membership fee! After getting some sleep and time to reflect upon the whole experience we can't help feeling taken advantage of and being treated like a cash register. I'm writing this review 12 days after we saw Dr. Getzelman and we still have not heard from them regarding our son's lab results! Â Considering that we were made to feel that getting these tests done ASAP was imperative to our son's well being we are shocked by the lack of follow up from them. Â Getzwell never seemed to advocate for our baby or us. Â They clearly do not have a handle on ""specialists"" they use and defer to. Â And they certainly did not provide anything close to concierge service. Â We found another pediatrician and promptly received an email from Getzwell telling us it would be $25 to transfer our son's records and may take up to 2 weeks to complete the transfer! Â They charged our card before they transferred the records. Â After some back and forth with their office manager they sent them over same day, but only after they rung our register one more time.",1,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Rikki Mcnally,"Let's begin by expressing my immense love and gratitude for this clinic. We have been seeing them since my son was born (I have a review listed on their noe clinic) but the continuous and genuine care they offer cant be bought. I have called on christmas -my son had a high fever, weekends and they respond to emails almost immediately and follow up to see if everything is ok! This office will provide genuine, uninterrupted care/time. I have never been rushed or shut down to move to another patient. I LOVE them and am so grateful. Its very clear why they were rated the #1 pediatricians office in sf. We were thrilled they opened a new office by our new home! Noe reviewLoving getzwell is an understatement. They are hands down the best doctors office Ive ever been to. Calm, clean and detail oriented, the staff here will never rush you, spend as much time as you need and are even available on weekends, evenings and holidays (yes Ive called during those times in emergency situations).

Rory Milner,"We have been with Getzwell for over 5 years and are so grateful for the thoughtful and supportive care they provide. We are especially grateful for Dr Glynn at the Union Street location as she has been our primary doctor for most of our daughters years. I had a lot of anxiety around vaccinations and they supported my choice to do an alternative schedule and every step of the way, I felt like I was making an informed and empowered decision. We've also made it through several bouts of illnesses without needing to give her antibiotics, which is incredible. It is true that appointments are always on time and never ever rushed. When my daughter was five days old, I was struggling with breastfeeding like so many moms do. I went in to Getzwell a total wreck, crying and feeling like a failure because she wasn't eating. They sat with me for six hours. SIX hours! Helping me work on the latch and getting her to eat. And every time we call with a question or a late night scare, they are always there with a thoughtful answer and never make us feel like we are a bother. I just wish more people could have access to this kind of care as it is truly life changing. I honestly wish I could find a practice like this for myself!

Mae Shields,"Dr. Getzelman has been my three children's pediatrician for the past 7 years. We were initially at a different practice in the city until my newborn got sick and after putting him repeatedly on antibiotics the doctor told me she didn't know what else to do. I sought out Getzwell Pediatrics and within a week Dr. Getzelman has solved my newborn's problem which never occurred again. We have since moved down to the peninsula and I still drive up to San Francisco to see Dr. Getzelman. That is how highly I think of her and her practice. It is a truly unique kind of medical attention that treats the entire child. I love the individual time I get with Dr. Getzelman, the nutrition support and creative ways to think of medical solutions. One of my children has asthma and behavior issues and Dr. Getzelman has developed treatment options for him without always relying on medication. I could not recommend this practice enough!",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Lilith Cantrell,"We have been with Getzwell for nine years, and have always found the staff to be extremely kind, efficient, and thorough.

Bobby Rush,"We learned about Getzwell Pediatrics when our son was 6 months old. We made the switch to Getzwell as we were looking for a more holistic approach to our child's care. Dr. Getzelman and Dr. Glynn are both warm, caring, and completely present providers. They go the extra mile to ensure all of my questions are answered and will provide me with research on a topic as needed. When our son was 15 months old, Dr. Getzelman was right by our side to help us through an emergency ear surgery which happened to fall on Christmas Day. As first-time parents, we were scared and concerned. She put us at ease immediately. A few months ago, Dr. Glynn came to our rescue when my son complained of a sore ear. I called and 15 minutes later Dr. Glynn was able to see our son and diagnose an ear infection. She suggested a homeopathic approach which worked wonders. Four days later the infection was gone. We love the nutrition counseling, the delayed (if desired) vaccine schedule, the personalized approach to our son's care, the quick response time to emails/calls, the clean and happy office, and the knowing that we are in the greatest of hands.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Shea Olson,"As a second time mom, I feel more clear than ever in what we need in our pediatricians. It's been a real honor to be in the care of dr Glynn and dr Getzelman, both caring and present providers, who have gone to extra mile to assure my sons' wellbeing. Dr Glynn is often on duty at the union street location and she blends competence, compassion and a mothers insight into the care she offers. My four month old developed pneumonia, which was a frightening thing, and meant we spent plenty of time contacting our docs and soliciting their advise. She was there, via email, checkins, over weekends and eves. She fielded even my silliest questions (which were not few :). I'm grateful to her for the endurance to see it through. She and Dr Getzelman consulted closely on the case and we felt we had two smart docs in our corner, 24/7. They took the time in required and operated prudently.Additionally, my toddler loves going to their bright office, which is saying something since it not infrequently results in a shot! He like to play doctor at home with his own stethoscope and sometimes he will say to me ""dr Glynn is on vacation so I'm working today"".. So he does identify Dr Glynn as a special doc that he emulates, even when he's pretending.They've brought on Karmi in the front desk who always has a smile and offers tea as I come in.. And another provider is now doing reimbursement work, so they can help you make claims if that's not a task you're interested in. From the in home first visits with newborns, to a slower vaccination schedule that takes the whole child into account, and the level of personalized care, I think it would be hard to improve on getzwell for pediatric care. We feel so lucky to be there.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Shannon Mill,"I signed my Son up to be a Patient of Getzwells' while I was still pregnant with him. I had so much faith that this was a Premier Practice and he would have incredible care. The first day my Son had diarrhea, I took him in for an appointment. There was no mention of dehydration, or was any real concern expressed about his sickness. While I realize a ""bout of diarrhea"" amongst children may happen; the after care by this Practice for close to 14 days failed my family so terribly that my Son ended up in the hospital for over SIX days. He needed to essentially be starved as he was put on complete gut rest and had to go into the operating room to have a PICC line inserted. A five-month old. Had I continued listening to Getzwell's advice: ""kids get sick - can last for fourteen days"", and not trusted my gut and called another SF Pediatrician, we were informed that my son was less than two days away from an urgent 911 call. I still shudder thinking about it. My Son was was considered an ""extreme"" case. Those are the words that the Hospital Doctors used when they looked at my Son. Yes. Extreme. He was anemic, had lost over 3 ounces in weight and dehydrated. Never once were my Son's blood levels taken by Getzwell, (or recommended to be taken). His minerals/nutrients never checked. Or his weight monitored. Very basic math tells me that if a child has recurrent diarrhea, he is probably losing weight. But more than that, he is unwell and his Pediatrician should be monitoring his case.I read the reviews below and realize, ""they are not an urgent care/emergency room"" but you know what, as my Son's Doctors, they are the FIRST line in a child being sick. I went to Urgent Care with my Son. I went to ER independently. I informed Getzwell as my Son's Doctors of everything going on. They did not act. They said they would get a ""referral for GI appointment marked urgent."" It never came and would have taken weeks. As Doctors, they have an obligation to be my child's first line of defense: do we as parents worry about a situation and escalate it or let nature run its course. I brought my Son in multiple times to see the Drs at Getzwell; I was made to feel as though I was over exaggerating when I tried to explain that my Son was very sick. He couldn't wear diapers his diaper rash was so painful from his frequent movements; upwards of 20 times a day. They recommended an organic diaper cream that you can't use on broken or irritated skin. How was that helpful? My husband and I both brought our Son in together to see Julia and spoke with her saying the care we were receiving was not up to standard for what we believe this practice stood for. She made me feel horrible and I left the appointment with her not even examining my Son. We paid $700 for these two visits [note: they've refunded the charges]. I spoke with Karmi, the office manager to have a chat about my dismay and a lack of care on my Son - the aftereffect provided no increased attention to my son's condition; instead Karmi had the audacity to call up my Son's new Pediatrician and yell at his office staff. Yes - they thought our new Doctor - who was actually monitoring my Son's case, [including, at one point, being on the phone with the OR managing by the minute, the amount of time my Son was under anesthesia during a tricky PICC line insertion due to dehydrated veins] - Â should spend his time responding to an angry office manager about a patient switch. I don't want to subscribe to the notion that they are the only holistic practice in SF. They are not. And I don't want to believe that because they recommend probiotics, that should preclude a Doctor from knowing when a baby is incredibly unwell. And they don't know. I'm writing this from one Parent to another: as a result of their lack of care, I had to watch my five month old have bruises all over his arms from IV attempts. I watched him be put in an ambulance to be taken to another hospital and then wheeled into an operating room &amp; the doors shutting without me being able to go in. I watched my Son come out of anesthesia. I watched him have to be starved for days. And all of this could have been prevented with Doctors that took the initial proper care of my Son that I entrusted them as his Doctors to do. And a level of service they assure they can provide; and - let's be frank - charge for it. The Hospital Professionals (Drs/Nurses) were HORRIFIED at Getzwell's care of my Son. So leave with this; that's great that they can do baby well checks. Or staggered vaccines. But when children get sick, will they know how to act appropriately, and mostly will they care? I think not. And I can assure you they did not care about this ""littlest patient."" But I'm incredibly thankful to my Son's new Pediatricians (Dr. Oded Herbsman and Dr. Castelli) - that did.",1,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Kerry Mcbride,"I spent many hours during my pregnancy researching pediatric practices in the Bay Area in search of one that felt like the right fit for our family. I can say with 100% certainty that Dr. Getzelman and Getzwell Pediatrics IS that practice and I am so incredibly grateful to have found them. We took our daughter Caroline to Getzwell when she was 3 days old for her first appointment and from the moment we walked in the door I felt supported and at ease. It is not easy to make a new mother feel at ease! My husband and I truly feel like the doctors at Getzwell are part of Caroline's ""team"". It is invaluable to feel that way towards your child's pediatrician and I cannot imagine it any other way. The front office staff is incredibly considerate, competent and efficient. I have never once had to sit with our daughter in the waiting room. Dr. Getzelman and Dr. Glynn are both incredibly warm, well spoken and as good with new parents as they are with kids! Our baby LOVES visiting Getzwell. I would think that was kind of weird if I weren't so grateful for it. I feel like I can (and do) ask them anything and they never make me feel dumb or silly or like I don't know what's best for my daughter. They are supportive and full of good information and sound advice. Anything and everything they've ever suggested to us or instructed us on has been presented in such a kind way without the slightest hint of condescension. For this I am incredibly appreciative. I feel as though they have taken the time to actually get to know our baby. Sometimes I'll watch Dr. Getzelman just observing her during our appointments and she's suggested things we might do with her (ie start solids or certain developmental exercises) based on these observations. There is no way a run of the mill pediatric practice is going to take the time to do this. It's little things like that that may not seem like much but they mean the world to a new mom who's trying to do what's very best for her child and learning as she goes. Collectively all of these things make Getzwell far superior to any other medical practice I've ever experienced (pediatric or otherwise). I would recommend them to any parent wholeheartedly and without reservation.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"

We were searching for a holistic pediatrician that supports trying homeopathic remedies before going the more conventional route, and we were extremely relieved and impressed when we found Getzwell. We just had our first appointment for our little one with Dr. Sheibani and as many other reviews have stated, we walked right in and immediately sat down with the Dr. She took the time to answer all of our questions... next thing we knew it had been over an hour! This was also after they were so flexible with the appointment time as we adjusted to our new 'schedule' with a newborn. Dr. Sheibani was even willing to work later to do a house call for us, although we ended up going in. All of the people we have interacted with at the practice are so friendly, compassionate, and knowledgeable... we really can't say enough great things about them thus far. We really look forward to our future appointments with them and love having peace of mind knowing that our child is in good hands.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"

Â When we were in France and my daughter had a strange rash all over her face and the local doctor wanted to put her in isolation for fear of it being measles, Julia diagnosed her rash using the pictures I sent and recommended over-the-counter and homeopathic treatments for what turned out to be infected insect bites. Even now that we moved to Marin when I have anything unusual going on with my kids' health (or my own), I ask Julia.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Brandy Cantrell,"I have been in the integrative healthcare field for over 15 years now, working closely with some of the pioneers of functional medicine, renowned midwives, herbalists, naturopaths, nutritionists, and bodyworkers. Â I know the real deal when I see it. Â When I first moved to the Bay, I spent more than a month interviewing providers. Â GetzWell Pediatrics was the ONLY practice I felt totally aligned with. Â From the start, I was able to engage in conversations with Dr. Getzelman about everything from nutrigenomics and microbiotica to epigenetics and preconception/prenatal interventions--at a time when no one in the general public was paying attention to things like probiotics, gut dysbiosis, or using food as medicine. Â Over the years, I have found Dr. G to be an incredibly well-informed medical professional (truly, she is always searching the horizons of medicine for things that can be of benefit to her families); a kind, present, and attentive care provider; and an astute clinical diagnostician. Â When the Union St office opened, I was so pleased that I could recommend this practice to my friends in Cow Hollow. Â Dr. Glynn, in particular, helped to care for a dear friend's premature daughter, who had very critical (and super stressful!!) health concerns throughout the first year of her life. Â This family could not have been in better hands. Â Getzwell takes the time to be a true partner in health and wellness, and I, for one, couldn't be more grateful.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Kayden Gomez,"We've been with GetzWell for over 4 years and with two kids. Julia Getzelman is the definition of a conscientious, caring, and invested care provider. They really practice ""whole kid care"" here, making sure to address not just physical health and development, but social/emotional and behavioral wellness. They are also very knowledgeable about the latest research in food and nutrition and have a refreshing integrative approach that employs the best aspects of both natural and western medicine. The hour-long appointments are not rushed, are so very thorough, and allow both the staff and families to form a relationship. I am deeply grateful for the amazing care Julia and her team have given my children over the years. One of my kiddos has severe immune issues and we have had our share of acute events with both kids. The pediatricians at GetzWell have always gone above and beyond to research, discuss, and guide us. For the longest time we have gone to their original Noe location, but since moving to the East Bay, we have gone to Union St. a couple times and it's just beautiful. Both locations are spotless, comfortable, and inviting for both kids and parents. (Yes, that's right- we moved to the East Bay and still commute to GetzWell because we simply couldn't find anything close to the care we so love and value.) My only regret is that we didn't start with GetzWell from the very beginning, but I am so glad we discovered such a wonderful and supportive resource. I truly see them as partners in fostering my kids' well being.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Hanan Connelly,"We just transitioned to GetzWell in the Marina after spending my son's first 20 months at another pediatrician's office. The transition has been incredibly smooth. Their office is well managed, communications are easy and timely and they always follow-up. Dr. Glynn was great at our first wellness visit, asked thoughtful questions and had a good dynamic with both myself and my son (who, I will be honest, hates going to the doctor at this point). I am so glad we switched pediatricians and I am looking forward to a long relationship with GetzWell.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Nicola Erickson,"Dr. G is one of the most amazing pediatricians you will find. Â Not only is she extremely bright, up to speed on the latest medical data, she is also kind and has an amazing bedside manner. When you have an appointment, you feel like you are the only patient that she has for the day. We love that there are 2 locations, Union Street and Church Street, as it adds to the convenience of the practice and appointment availability. Dr. Getzelman is also sensitive to parent's fears of medicine and treatment and takes a very supportive role and does not over medicate, this is a good thing. Â She will absolutely tell you when you need to medicate, but as with most childhood illnesses, there isn't a need for drugs. My daughter has been a patient of Dr. Gs since she was 3 weeks old and is now 4.5 years old. My daughter LOVES going to the office to see her, which speaks volumes for the environment she has created at her practice. Â  Her team helped support our journey with breastfeeding and early childhood nutrition. Â We trust her opinion with our most sacred thing in life, our child.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"
Harlow Morley,"As a new mother with an acute awareness of the complexities in raising a healthy child, I was elated when Getzwell opened their Union Street office. Â I loved the office in Noe, but this one is much more convenient and I better understand what makes them unique. Before my son was born, I thought my choices were limited to either high volume impersonal practices on the one hand or very expensive concierge practices on the other. But, Getzwell is just the right balance, with truly holistic care and docs really interested in a relationship. I feel so incredibly lucky, they don't think I'm crazy to question vaccines or be concerned about BPA in canned goods, etc. Â Getzwell's docs are sensitive to the needs (and anxieties) of our family and have created a customized care plan just for us. Â And, I loved the fact that after delivery, they provided a newborn house call. Â Since then, I've found their services are unrushed, appointments are easy to book and I can reach them by phone or email whenever necessary. The office is beautiful, super clean and modern to top it all off. GetzWell Pediatrics is where it's at.",5,Getzwell Personalized Pediatrics,"Pediatricians, Nutritionists, Naturopathic/Holistic"

He is a fantastic surgeon, but this review isn't for him.The presidio surgery center made me feel comfortable and safe throughout the entire process. The covid precautions were great (just make sure you get a test within 7 days of your procedure)..In the pre-surgery area, the staff were so caring and kind. Shoutout to Matt who went above and beyond to calm my nerves and show care.Recovery room was just as good. I never felt rushed, and felt totally cared for.

Teegan Gonzales,"I was scheduled for a procedure at the Presidio Surgery Center, which is located amongst several medical buildings in the area. Â From downtown the 38 Geary stops a block away. Â The Center also validates parking in the building's garage. You pre-register online which expedites the check-in process when you arrive. The staff at the Center are very friendly. Â Upon arrival, the receptionist checks you in and takes care of the paperwork and any necessary payments. Then Rebecca, the RN, walks me to a prep room for some procedural questions and provided me the gowns for changing. Â Afterward, she returns and walks me back to the prep area where she and Trish preps me with the IV. Â During this time, you're kept comfortable with warm blankets. The anesthesiologist comes by to discuss the process for my procedure. Then my Doctor comes to see how I'm doing and reassures me the procedure will be quick and painless. During the waiting time, the nurses come to check how I'm doing and status of my procedure. Â When it's time, they walk you to the procedure room and they reassure you that you are under the best care. Â Before I know it, the procedure was done and I awoke back in the prep room. Â They give you refreshments and crackers. Â When you are ready, you get dressed and they take you to the garage where my sister was waiting to drive me home. Â The staff was very friendly and professional.

Nelly Leonard,"Having worked in medical settings for years as a physical therapist, I know something about what quality health care looks like. I was very impressed with this facility. It is clear that there are thoughtful policies and procedures in place and that they are followed. This speaks to serious supervision and high standards. Further, it appears that all the staff appreciate being able to work in a setting where high expectations are consistent. Mind you I am well aware that provision of care is now measured by patient satisfaction rather than rather than clinical outcomes. It is clear that the staff go out of their way to ""be nice"" but in doing so, they are better aware of patients' individual needs and act accordingly, not just parrot some scripted responses. I never got the feeling someone wasn't listening to me. Not to mention that my lumbar epidural was handled expertly by Dr. Ignatius and the nursing staff. I traveled 20 miles to get treatment there but I would travel much farther if needed to get such quality medicine.",5,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"

Go somewhere else where they treat you with respect. Â Somehow, in the medical profession they think they can always get away with this.

These procedures can be nerve wrecking to some especially for the ones who have never been put to sleep. The back office staff was amazing. No complaints. Dr. Roache is the best orthopedic I have came across and I have worked for orthopedic surgeons for the past 4 years. Â Clean center.

Jodi Browning,"I had a steroid injection procedure last week at Â PSC and was impressed by their great service. A few weeks prior to the surgery, they contacted me to let me know that my insurance had approved the procedure. The gal was very friendly and answered a lot of detailed questions I had about the procedure. She then called again a week before the procedure to confirm the details with me again. And then, 24 hrs prior to the surgery, another staff member followed up with me to see if I had any further questions. The day of the procedure was just as organized. I arrived on time, got signed in and was immediately taken back to get going on my procedure. Once I got changed, the first nurse took me into the pre-op waiting room and got me settled into a comfortable chair while she prepped me. As soon as she was finished, my surgeon showed up and went over the details with me again. As soon as he was finished, a new nurse took me into the operating room and we started the procedure. Although it was painful, all of the staff were great at answering my questions and distracting me from the pain. I was in and out of the operating room in no time and then was wheeled into the post-op recovery room where again, two additional nurses made sure I was comfortable and kept checking on me.Although it is never a fun experience to have any kind of surgical procedure, this center almost made me feel like I was at a high end spa because everyone was so attentive and made sure I was comfortable.",5,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"

Â In all seriousness, surgery is no fun, but PSC made the entire experience (I cannot even say ""ordeal"") manageable. Â Everyone was very calm and friendly. Â They answered any and all questions. Â And if you have any fears about surgery I can tell you that once the anesthesiologist gives you the drip you will not remember anything. Â All rather lovely, actually. Â I also must give a big round of applause to my ENT Dr. Gary Rust who made the effort to apply for surgery privileges at PSC in order to perform my sinus surgery.

This facility is simply amazing. The staff who greet you and take your insurance/paperwork are very courteous and well organized. From the moment they take you back to the prep side of the center, you're constantly checked on by the fabulous nurses and medical assistants. They keep you posted as to about how much longer the wait will be, ensure that you're comfortable with a blanket fresh from the warmer and even offer noise cancelling headphones with relaxation music to ease the anxiety of your pending procedure should you need it. Once it's ""time"" they take you into the procedure room, I'm sure the experience could vary based on your doctor, but I feel confident and at ease that I'm receiving the best care. After they finish up, it's off to the other side of the facility for observation before they let you go home. The nurses are all very compassionate, check on you multiple times and offer juice/water and goldfish crackers (bonus!). They don't make you feel rushed and let you stay as long as you need until you're feeling ready to go. This place is so efficient, it could easily feel like you're in a processing wearhouse being shuffled along.

Amelie Best,"I had a traumatic experience here from start to finish. Waiting room is a complete zoo. People packed in with no regard for age, disability, discomfort level, type of procedure - like a cattle yard at a slaughterhouse. Staff unresponsive to questions and unconcerned about patients except to extract payment. Medical techs untrained and insensitive. When I didn't want to answer personal questions in a public place, I was put in a supply room and had to stand for this part of the ordeal. The pre-op area is crowded as full as possible - patients are put into tiny curtained stalls nearly naked and freezing cold to wait for the MD. As I was there for an epidural I was in extreme pain and very frightened. The MD expected me to walk down the hall in a paper robe that barely covered my rear and was annoyed that I asked for more coverage. It wasted his valuable time. He did and said nothing to reassure me. In the surgery room a woman held my hand and told me that I wouldn't feel anything but if I did they would make sure I was immediately made comfortable. I had intense pain right away but was told that I didn't need more anaesthesia yet. I began to moan and then to howl, but the doc didn't stop to check in with me about the pain and the woman kept telling me it didn't hurt that much. I was in agony. I told them to stop, that I wanted to leave, but they didn't listen and kept on going as if I was an animal. It was like a nightmare, a torture chamber. BEWARE ! NEVER NEVER GO HERE.

Â Extra blankets, giving me an extra gown to cover the gaping back of the hospital gown, socks to pad around in, asking me about holiday plans, checking in with me during surgery, I couldn't have been better cared for.

In addition, they waited 6 months to send me a bill for an amount over and above the original estimate, then after trying to better understand it, sent it to collections after two weeks. Totally unethical and definitely not on the consumer's side. What's the point of an estimate if it is wildly inaccurate and includes everything except materials (which are ALWAYS a part of the procedure)?

Â These included:Suhayla-Front Desk (great first impression at 7:30am)Anne-Pre-op (love the British accent-very comforting)Marianne, RN-Procedure Room-(Fun to talk and very good at keeping my mind off getting poked repeatedly with many sharp needles)Barbara- Very sweet to get me a much needed cup of coffee in recovery.I hope my spinal problem is solved and I never need to go back to Presidio.

Claire Marin,"Presidio Surgery Center was just as I expected it - a well oiled machine that works very smoothly. Â I had several conversations with them prior to my surgery - a call about benefits and insurance coverage which was extremely helpful, calls about my medical history, instructions for the day of surgery, etc.When I arrived on the day of my knee surgery, I was greeted promptly, filled out some final forms, and was taken in to change into my scrubs and have my vitals taken. Â Next up I was in a recliner getting an IV started, and a few minutes later I was in the operating room and the anesthesiologist was telling me that I'd feel a little sting and burn - and I woke up about 90 minutes drooling and calling out my husband's name.The kindness and efficiency of the staff, along with the gestures like warm blankets, saltines and cups of water post-op to hold down the nausea, painkillers and ice packs - all added to my positive feelings. Â The post-surgery nurse spent some time with my husband going over my instructions to make sure he understood everything (since I was in no shape to understand anything) that needed to be done once I was home.I would've given them five stars but for the attitude of one nurse. Â He was clearly overworked and stressed out, but dude - don't give me attitude when I haven't eaten in 16 hours and am about to undergo general anesthesia to have some fairly serious surgery, OK?Otherwise, a very positive experience and I definitely recommend it if you need to have some minor surgery.",4,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"
Arwen Sanders,"I thought my outpatient arthroscopic knee surgery experience was going to be like being processed through a chop shop, but I was pleasantly surprised. Every staff person from the front desk check-in babe to the nurses and anesthesiologist were all chipper and patient and attentive. It was like the Michael Minna version of a hospital experience, with no less than five people attending to me at any given time. I especially appreciated the efficiency, the heated blankets they wrapped me in before surgery, and the fact that they didn't laugh at my babbling when coming out of anesthesia (speaking Italian, asking if I could see my surgery on YouTube, calling the anesthesiologist my boyfriend's name). Unlike Michael Minna, however, I hope I never have to go here again.The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that they don't call you with your estimated copay until the day before surgery. Both in my case and in a coworker's case, we unexpectedly owed about $1,500! A huge added worry that I didn't appreciate. However, they will work with you.",4,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"
Jamie Mays,"I'm not a big fan of being drugged to the point of blackin out Â but when you need surgery...that's what they do!I recently had knee surgery and it went great. From the time I walked into the waiting room to the time I left, everything was fantastic. The staff was nice and attentive. They didn't stick me in a room and leave me to ponder what was about to happen for hours on end. I was brought from one station to the next in and very controlled and well planned out path to the operating room. Â I was able to meet the nurse that was assisting on the surgery as well as the anesthesiologist Â to discuss my options. Everyone was nice, professionals and made me feel good.I entered the OR and the people in there just struck a conversation as they prepped me. Before I knew what was happening, I was loaded and the asleep.

Michele Cortes,"First Class ExperienceMy outpatient surgery on Dec 28th at Presidio Surgery Center was about as good as surgery can get. Â I was very comfortable throughout my entire stay from check-in through recovery. Â  Â A few noteworthy things from a day I don't remember completely:* The nursing staff exuded warmth, compassion, and attention to detail. Â It's more like a spa than a hospital! Â The IV tech/nurse is so good you may not realize you just had an IV inserted!* The staff was very accommodating with my wife asking for my 2 year old son to visit me in recovery (thankfully my toddler was well behaved!). Â * The parking spot immediately outside the recovery area makes discharge exceptionally easy (CPMC Pacific should take notes on this). Â * The atmosphere is very relaxing and confidence inspiring. Â * You have a recovery nurse assigned to you, but, that doesn't stop the other nurses from checking up on your comfort level when they pass you.

Thierry Contreras,"I had arthroscopic hip surgery with Dr. Chan last week Â and so far everything has gone so impressively well. He has checked in with me everyday to make sure everything is going smooth. I felt really prepared going in knowing what I needed to have ready at home afterwards, and what I needed to stop doing beforehand.

Thanks everyone!",5,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"
Chase Hulme,"Be careful with this surgery center. They make you sign a payment installment plan right before you enter in the OR before they even know how much your insurance will pay. Then when you get your insurance settlement you figure out you over pay. They still want you to pay the whole amount and Jennifer Fox will send you threatening letter before your installments are due urging you to pay before the installment is due or else they will send you to collection agency. Money I don't owe them yet and that my insurance told not to pay as it is not due. If you can convince your surgeon to do your surgery somewhere else I suggest you do or you will end up like me, with a threatening letter for money I do not owe to them. I am hiring a lawyer to deal with them. Do not have your surgery here!",1,Presidio Surgery Center,"Medical Centers, Neurologist, Anesthesiologists"
Lennon Dyer,"DO NOT BOOK YOUR SURGERY HERE! Â The Presidio Surgery Center has a history of unethicial and immoral accounting practices. I booked with Presidio Surgery Center in November 2014 because they appeared to be qualified and professional. Before my appointment I received a ""courtesy call"" from their accounting dept notifying me that I will be required to prepay my entire bill upfront on the day of my surgery. Â The account manager said she had already contacted my insurance company and CONFIRMED that the amount due to patient was $1,500. Â So I agreed to pay this amount before my surgery, and assumed the debt was settled. Â Two months after the surgery I received a bill for $1,100. Â I called and they said, ""This is the balance due. Â There was a change to your scope of services and your insurance company didn't pay this amount."" Â Change to my scope of services? Â I reviewed the initial scope and the final scope, and I was horrified to find that they ommitted a standard procedure in the initial scope so the prepaid bill appeared LOWER than the final bill. Â Furthermore, I called to discuss this with my insurance company, who said they NEVER EVEN RECIEVED A CALL FROM THEM! Â If I had known there would be such a dramatic difference in cost beforehand, I would have shopped around to other centers. Â Since then, I've seen several other Yelp reviewers with the same experience. Â Presidio Surgery Center has a long history of ""bait and switch"" accounting practices.

Zoey Penn,"Professional, caring, kept me fully informed about what was about to occur every step of the entire process.. Great follow up, truly a fully professional staff. Even though this is an outpatient facility and needs to operate very efficiently, at no time did I feel they were unconcerned about me as a patient. (Not just another surgery.) At all times I felt that I was being treated as the only patient with whom they were concerned. Even the simple things were attended too. (One nurse commented ""This blanket is not as warm as I normally like them."" during pre-op preparation.) Nothing was taken for granted and an extreme attention to detail. They even did an additional EKG on me since my last one was about 5 months old. Every action taken from admitting to discharge was explained. Best outpatient surgery experience I have had. (This was my third, with a Â prior meniscus knee repair, shoulder rotator cuff repair and now a Â sports hernia repair .)

Charity Hyde,"Total Health Dental Emeryville has terrible administrative staff/receptionists. I have been going to THD for about 2 years now and it took 4 visits for them to finally send me reminders for my appointments. The most frustrating thing about this is that I would get marketing texts from THD but they couldn't send me appointment reminders...there's clearly something wrong here. My second time going to THD they helped me make an appointment to get my teeth cleaned but when I got to my appointment, they told me I would have to make another appointment/come back at a later date if I wanted the doctor to look at my teeth. Why wouldn't they just tell me upfront that the doctor wouldn't be in/who wants to have to take time off of work and go to the dentist twice?? Does THD get more money from insurance companies by splitting appointments like this?My partner also goes to THD (shame on me for referring him) and they always seem to mix up appointment times for both of us - it's not just me! Luckily I've gotten in the habit of calling the week of to confirm my appointment. There was one instance where a receptionist called my partner about an appointment he had coming up in a few days and asked if he could come in the next day because if he came in the day he was scheduled for, they would have to stay late and they would prefer not to do that...this is obviously wrong for many reasons.The only reason I haven't switched dentists yet is because of COVID (at least THD is clean), as soon as COVID clears I will absolutely be switching dentists.Oh and if you're curious why they have such a high Yelp rating, it's because they give their patients extra mouth wash and things like that if you leave them a good review... YIKES.",1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Karan Mason,"I have been coming to this location for years, and their service has always been top notch. While many other practices are always an administrative mess, Total Health is organized and efficient. Scheduling is easy and painless, and any insurance/billing queries are always resolved quickly and effectively.The cleanings, exams, and dental work I've had here have also been pleasant (as pleasant as dental work goes). Jean-Claude takes great care of me whenever I come in. He thoroughly cleans out my teeth and gums while weaving in just the right amount of conversation to help a person feel comfortable. X-rays and imaging are quick and painless, aided by the modern, high-tech equipment they have at the office. I've had fillings done here as well, and they're always painless (with just the right amount of anaesthetic) and done carefully. I've never had any issues or the problems with follow ups.

Lindsay Brown,"I have gone to a new dentist that is in-network with Delta Dental after my disastrous visit with Total Health Dental Care.The new dentist has determined that I don't need a deep cleaning nor do I need 2 fillings. He said I needed a thorough normal cleaning (which I was supposed to have had a week ago from Total Health Dental Care) and to take a wait and see approach with the fillings as they were minor, and to try a prescription fluoride toothpaste. My husband was told he needed a molar removed, the new dentist has said he doesn't need any teeth removed. Beware of dental scams.Top things are:1. Useless treatments/phantom treatments.2. Shoddy work3. Inflated bills and out of pocket costs. Get a second opinion on expensive work.4. Being pressured to do 'urgent dental work 'now' by dental staff. Get a second opinion.With Total Health Dental Care, I experienced shoddy work (lack of a normal cleaning), inflated out of pocket costs (far higher than market rate for this area), and pressure to do expensive work I did not need. I cannot recommend. Please go elsewhere if Total Health Dental Care are urging you to do expensive work, and get a second opinion.And if you have Dental Insurance, please go to an in-network dentist. Out-of Network dentists are too expensive, the care is going to be the same or better, the cost will be lower.

Keziah Blundell,"I ended up at THDC in Emeryville because I had a dental emergency (and naturally, that emergency had to happen during a pandemic). For all the praise people might want to heap on their competitors, those practices sure aren't interested in seeing someone without dental insurance on short notice, even if they can pay immediately. I got quite the runaround at some other practices, but no help.I had never had or needed any kind of dental work beyond cleaning before so really had no idea what to expect. I was not upsold on the more expensive procedure on my first visit (I fully went in expecting a crown to be the only solution and would have been ok with that), giving me a chance to go home and live with the tooth and see if the less expensive treatment was workable long-term. Ultimately I preferred the crown, so I scheduled the appointment. Not having any experience with getting a crown, I think the entire process went smoothly and quickly. I know that Dr. Yang went above and beyond on my case and was insistent on getting a good match with my other teeth. She rejected the first crown from the lab because it wasn't a good match, and actually made me an entirely second option that she hand-detailed. When I showed up to verify the match and get the crown put on, I had multiple options to choose from. I absolutely would not have expected that, and I wasn't upcharged for the additional choice. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but the entire process and final procedure was pretty much painless and done with care. Dr. Yang has great chair-side manner, and I felt fortunate that she was the dentist on my case. While I was getting my crown put on, the office actually had a cancellation for a cleaning, so I was also able to get a cleaning immediately after since I was already there. I really appreciated that they offered me the slot.Overall I've found everyone at this office friendly and accommodating. I had an issue with my car right before my last cleaning and called 25 minutes before my appointment was supposed to happen to let them know I wouldn't be making it, making me That Person (and no one likes to be That Person). The person that helped me out was understanding and helped me quickly reschedule the cleaning. At the cleaning. Dr. Yang came over immediately to check on how the crown was working out and if there were any issues to report, since it was my first time in the office post-crown. I hadn't even expected to see her, so I appreciated the in-person followup.This office is convenient to me and in a nice location.

The X-rays are high-tech too, but a bit physically uncomfortable (because of the bit piece)-- though, no more so than at another dentist. They send the appointment confirmation via SMS, which is excellent, but it includes a link to the THDC office closest to you, even if your appointment is at another location, so heads up for that.

Caelan Velasquez,"I went to this company based on the outstanding Yelp reviews and the convenient Emeryville location, a decision I greatly regret. My experience with Total Health Dental has been a nightmare since I scheduled my first appointment. When making the appointment to see a dentist for an exam and x-rays I was informed that I couldn't do this at the Emeryville location and that all new patients had to be seen at the ""Welcome Office"" in Berkeley, which round trip would cost me $20 just to visit, but I thought ""it's okay, it'll be the only time I have to go there and my dental insurance is covering the cost of the visit."" The latter would have been true if this company wasn't utterly unscrupulous. When I made my appointment I specified it was NOT an emergency and when I went into the office for my appointment I specified it was NOT an emergency, but Natalid said to sign the emergency paperwork, otherwise I would not be seen. I assumed this was for coronavirus liability, but I was incorrect.They charged my insurance $150 for the ""emergency appointment"" and the x-rays were another $200, which is overpriced even for the Bay Area. Now, because of these unreasonable prices, I'm forced to pay $209 out of pocket. Â I can get an exam, x-rays, and a cleaning for $99 from a nearby dentist that was voted Best in the Bay for many years, and that's WITHOUT insurance. It also turns out that Total Health doesn't participate with my insurance, Delta Dental, so coverage is Out of Network, something I wasn't informed of. Total Health also pushes hard to get you appointments for treatment immediately, so before I was aware of the initial cost for the x-rays and ""emergency appointment"" I scheduled a cleaning and an extraction, but insisted they provide a quote for treatment. Getting an accurate quote was extremely difficult. Natalid from the billing department gave me quotes for a bunch of things I didn't ask for, at which point I became very concerned with this business's competency and canceled the appointments. To further reenforce my concerns, on the days of my canceled appointments I was called and asked where I was. I had to inform them that I had canceled my appointments in advance with Yolanda. While this may seem trivial, it isn't. This company charges $50 for any appointment not canceled 48 hours in advance and $200 per hour if you were scheduled with a doctor, as was the case with my extraction appointment. I tried to confirm that I would not be charged these fees since I canceled the appointments appropriately, yet I did not receive a response until I posted this review. Needless to say, I will not be getting dental treatment from Total Health Dental EVER.",1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Jess Bentley,"I hadn't visited a dentist in years (tbh I did virtually no research before booking a teeth cleaning appointment). This was a year ago during the pandemic. So many offices had really long waitlists and Total Health had teeth cleaning openings for the next week so I decided to pay out of pocket for a teeth cleaning--which btw is reasonably priced.... I paid around $500 for 2 teeth cleanings for the next year, and that also covers a root canal if I would end up needing one in the next 12 months.. Sounded reasonable enough. Â Well, I really am impressed by the care provided here.Since the beginning I have been impressed by the different dentists who have given me teeth cleanings (there are several dentists at this facility). Â My very first appointment I had X-rays done and the health of my teeth were assessed by Dr. Peggy Chuang. She gave me practical advice for my own teeth. Â At one point she also asked me "" Which category do you put yourself in when visiting the dentist's office? Are you a) someone who wants to keep your teeth forever b) visiting the dentist for only emergencies, or c) wanting an instagram smile? I put myself in category A. I was thankful that she cared to ask such a practical question and wouldn't be shoving cosmetic procedure advice down my throat during future visits Â unless I was the right type of patient! Overall I'm glad there is a dentist office in the Bay Area that has a holistic outlook with reasonable prices!!! (Even affordable enough that if you didn't have insurance you could pay out of pocket for the next several years and it not break your bank! They are also mostly women run which probably explains the efficiency of the workplace.The last neat thing they office is THEY HAVE A LIBRARY IN THE WAITING ROOMS!

I got my cleaning by Jean-Claude RDH, he made sure to let me know what I needed to do to maintain my teeth. The cleaning was $129 and I mentioned seeing the yelp promo for a free X-ray and exam, which helped a lot for me since I don't have dental insurance. Thanks for a great dental experience.

Jean Dotson,"I hadn't had a great experience at my last dentist and had a great time switching to Total Health Dental in Emeryville. Jean-Claude performed the cleaning with virtually zero discomfort, and was so pleasant to visit with -- I genuinely came home and told my roommmate that I'm sad I'm moving away because I want to be pals with Jean-Claude! The entire setup was impressively set up with proper PPE to reduce risk of COVID, and when I had an issue with my insurance rejecting the claim for the exam, Total Health Dental's insurance team was amazingly quick to re-file a new claim, assuring me they'd ensure everything gets sorted out and I won't be charged any unexpected out of pocket fees. Had a great experience and would definitely recommend!",5,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Finnley Huber,"This was my first visit to the Emeryville Total Health office and as always when I have new people working on my teeth, I was apprehensive. Gabby, who heads the front desk, patiently and professionally explained what I could expect with their dentist and dental hygienist. If only more front office medical staff were as kind and compassionate! Â Jean-Claude cleaned my teeth gently and quickly. No pain! And he gave helpful advice about electric toothbrushes (not just for lazy people, apparently!). Â I really appreciated this office's relaxed, friendly vibe. Also non-judgey and good humored too which is extra nice right now. I'll be back in 6 months and looking forward to it!",5,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Juliet Woodard,"I had a great experience at Total Health Dental! I had been going to the same dentist for many years and finally decided it was time to try out a new dentist and I'm so glad I did. Everyone at the office was so welcoming and pleasant. I was surprised that I didn't have to wait for my appointment, and the cleaning was over in just 30 minutes. Plus, it was all relatively pain-free, which was unexpected because so many of my past dentist visit have been unpleasant. Jean-Claude RDH was fantastic, super friendly, and had some great recommendations for me about how to take better care of my teeth. I will definitely be back!",5,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Lacy Conway,"Yah, this company is super shady, even if the dentists in their network are amazing. They use bait and switch on their ""subscription"" system to get you to pay more for services. Run, don't walk, away from these crooks. The management company keeps swallowing up smaller independent dentist practices and ruining their reputations.I went to see Dr. Alison and he pulled out my broken tooth, quickly and without a fuss. All good. I was then immediately corralled into the billing office for an intense 45 minute sales pitch. Yup, while bleeding profusely from a brand new hole in my jaw, with a mouth full of gauze, I signed up for what sounded like a great way to get free cleaning, x-rays, AND massage, AND nutritional advice, for a measly $30 per month on my credit card. Â Since I'm self-employed and can't afford dental insurance, I really wanted to address my lack of regular dental care so it seemed like a really great thing, and I scheduled a cleaning right away. They were pushing me really hard to get about $2000 worth of below-the-gums cleaning, and I repeatedly had to explain that there was no way I could afford that, but a regular cleaning would be great.Well, I got that cleaning, not from Dr. Alison but from a really really young thing that probably did a great job (what do I know? I'm not a dentist). I left happy, and didn't have to pay the usual $275 or so because I'd signed up for the $30/month subscription, right? Right! Awesome.For some reason, though, a couple of months later I got a bill for $300, which was pretty confusing. Calling them about it got me a receptionist, who just couldn't seem to get the accountant on the phone. Wow, surprise!tl;dr : I'm still getting bills from them for this mysterious $300 that they claim I owe them, and today on Yelp I see that the exact same thing happened to someone using a dentist in their company in Oakland. The exact. Same. Thing. I'm going to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and find another dentist.I feel bad for Dr. Alison. He's a great dentist, and he was referred to me by a friend who he's helped a lot. I hear from her recently that he's very unhappy with the relationship with Total Health. I wonder why.",1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Jay Snow,"Sharing an update. I was initially disappointed with my experience in trying to schedule an appointment for cleanings and xray. After sharing my experience on yelp, I received a call form the office to schedule an appointment. I have to say my experience in the office was quite pleasant. Everyone was friendly, and my appointment went as planned. I was in and out in about an hour. This location is convenient for me so I will continue to come. This dentistry fosters ""whole health"" so they did some untraditional things like take my blood pressure and schedule me a for a free massage. Its pretty cool for a dentist to do that! Also a pretty cool tidbit: the doctor makes his own mouth wash and its quite tasty!",4,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Gurveer Zamora,"I moved and was looking for a new dentist. I really like you can schedule online and the office is very nice. When I booked online as a new patient they didn't also schedule a cleaning, and there was no option to add a cleaning so I assumed it would happen at the same appointment, if did not. I see the dentist every 6 months, but they tried to tell me they needed to fix 4 fillings that weren't good enough and I had one cavity. How can I go from my last appointment 6 months ago with everything is fine to needing 1500+ in dental work? If they struggled to fix the filling they would either leave it or give me a crown, if you can leave it, then why do you need to fix it? Why risk messing it up and then needing a crown? I was there for an hour and a half and I didn't even get a cleaning. I felt they were very pushy, trying to get me to get unnecessary services. When I said I would think about it think about it, the dentist came back and was more pushy. I didn't want to schedule a cleaning and the receptionist tried to get me in as a place holder appointment and we could reschedule even though I said I didn't want to make one. I had to just walk away. The worst part for me was when the dentist wanted me to floss for her, since she didn't believe me I flossed. It was all very performative and felt very patronizing. I don't go to the dentist to get talked down to, if you think I need to floss better, say that, don't talk down to me.",1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Rowan Crosby,"Love this place! I get great service from the receptionist to the RDH, Jean-Claude, every time. I like that they remind me of my upcoming appointments with emails and texts. I highly recommend!",5,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Levi Lawson,Dr Alison's practice has been bought out by total health. Nothing but one problem after the next after trying to get a single crown done.

Lucca Mcdonnell,"I highly recommend the the Broadway location. Dr. Cassidy and Monica did an amazing job, and I'm comfortable moving forward with more more work at this location.The staff are supportive funny and very efficient. It's my first time laughing out loud with the nitrous! My first visit was at Emeryville, closer to my home. The patients who've been going there for years say great things. I had an abscess and experienced inefficient staff who show minimal respect, empathy or patient care. Â Took three weeks and many lapses in follow through for them to refer me to the awesome Broadway office for surgery. Emeryville also charged me 65% upfront when my plan actually covers 80%, then told me I was not scheduled for surgery. Â If I was not in so much pain, the buffoonery at Emeryville would have been a good comedy sketch. Go to Broadway or one of the professional practices.",1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Ariel Edmonds,"My 5-star review of Dr Allison remains unchanged - he's still the best dentist ever. Unfortunately the office itself was recently bought and is now the exact sort of corporate-feeling place I prefer to avoid with medical care. Gone is the independent family business with the personalized care; suddenly it's hard even to get through to a human, and harder to get a callback, even on a message we left in the middle of the night when a tooth broke, asking for a callback in the morning. This lack of a callback (most just asking for appts) has happened 5 times already and Total Health has only been in charge a few months. With medical care increasingly faceless and impersonal, I loved this remaining holdout. I'm staying for Ana's and Dr Allison's dedication and expertise, and if they ever left I'd follow them anywhere, but Total Health - meh. Same ol', same ol', right down to the annoyingly cute outgoing messages.",3,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"
Ty Cousins,I normally hate going to the dentist but they have a very approachable atmosphere. All the staff are incredibly nice and friendly.

Indiana Gilmore,I'm pretty sure this place will be selling Pizza's Â soon. This place is not the same and there's no affiliation with Dr Allison! The office manager is incompetent and she doesn't care about the patients. They spoke bad of Dr. Allison's work and they made him out to be some kind of crook. Please don't waste your time or money with this place. I wonder if the people that work here are certified to do the job they're performing!,1,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Mackenzie Suarez,"Dr. Allison sold his business, and it's now not the same. Â IF you get Dr. Allison, you'll get excellent dental care. Â But the customer service end of things is really lacking. Â The office is now part of a big conglomeration of dental offices with one main switchboard and office. Â SO, back before this happened, they answered their own phones, called you right back, and everything was great. Â Now, you call and listen to an overly cute phone message, you press the appropriate button and leave a message, and they don't call back. Â It's really a shame. Â Dr. Allison is a great dentist, but I fear that the service is going downhill. Â I gave 3 stars to give them the benefit of the doubt, but will lower it if nothing changes by my next visit.",3,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Christie Kerr,"I have been with Dr Allison and the old crew of oral hygienist for 12 years and was very happy until he sold the business. I told the new oral hygienist that my old hygienist had a particular way of cleaning my teeth due to sensitivity. The oral hygienist offered local anesthesia to numb my sensitivity but I refused as I never had to use it in the past. Also, she accused my old hygienist of being negligent for not using the ""gold standard,"" (a machine that removes tooth plaque rather than just using periodontal scalers). I proceeded with the ""gold standard"" anyway as I was there and I was due for cleaning.Before the procedure began, she asked what I did for work, but due to her being disrespectful to my past experience and condemning that there is only the current gold standard method, I decided to keep my interaction short and gave her a short answer without further going into details. Would my work experience relate to my current dental treatment anyway? Then she quickly assumed that I did not want to talk and therefore said, we do not need to talk.As the teeth cleaning procedure proceeded mid-way. She left and had a conversation with the office manager. The office manager then came to help her document my receding gum line measurements and all other documentation. But out of the blue the oral hygienist stated that ""I REFUSED oral hygiene teaching."" The manager nodded and stated that she will also document that without assessing the scenario to begin with. I may not want to talk about matters that do not relate to my dental health but to automatically assume that I refuse teaching of oral hygiene? Seriously? If my work experience mattered to your assessment of my health history, maybe as a healthcare professional you could have kindly stated a reason for your question. At this point, I was really upset as I proceeded quietly with her way of cleaning my teeth. I would at times become uncomfortable and started gagging during the cleaning but that was as much response I had to her way of teeth cleaning. When I became uncomfortable, the oral hygienist would give up not cleaning those areas and assume a measurement of my molar without further assessment or asking some other technician or doctor to help.The company promotes a spa experience that uses alternative methods to make the customer feel comfortable, but the experience was not measuring up to the advertisement.

Maddy Holding,"Disclosure: This is my own personal experience that I want to share so that people can hopefully learn to ask questions and inquire when procedures are pushed unto you.I went in for a general cleaning. After the xrays the dentist told me I had a little sliver of tooth which was a remnant of my wisdom tooth removed 10 years ago. It hadnt bothered me all these years and no other dentist has even mentioned it before. I was told about it and initially I declined his offer to remove it. The dentist essentially said that its an easy procedure, 5 minutes, single cut, and will heal in the next few hours. After awhile he finally convinced me to do it. I went to pay my copay and was handed a bill for over 100 dollars. I wish he would have mentioned that it was considered ""surgery"" and that while my insurance covered 90% of the procedure that I was going to have to pay more. The worst part is when I came back a several months later and they billed me for the ""surgery"" again and told me it was because I paid the estimate and that didnt cover the actual cost.",2,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Glen Anthony,"I waited a few months before leaving a review. It helps in providing a more relevant feedback. Initially you may have a lot of pain, or you may be happy a procedure is over.I called Dr. Allison's office to make an appointment. A wisdom tooth had caved in. I was given an appointment within a week. His assistant, who is very kind, took my X-rays. The doctor gave me options for treatment. I had teeth cleaning, filling and wisdom tooth removal done at his office. I referred my wife who was also happy with the services provided. What I like the most is that you don't get pressured to have multiple things done. Dr. Allison gives you professional opinion and leaves the ultimate decision up to you. His staff are also very helpful in providing feedback on the amount of remaining coverage. Dr. Allison seems like a guy who you would go out and have a drink with. His colleague, Dr. King, carried out the tooth extractionis also an awesome guy.",5,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Â The most disturbing thing is that each and every time I have gone to an appointment, the personal information of the previous patient is still up on the screen for me (and everyone else) to see.

Anna took good care of me as she took all of my X-rays diligently; she was gentle and super thorough. Then Jean Claude completed my dental cleaning; he didn't make me feel bad for not seeing a dentist in years. He held great conversation while making me feel comfortable and was still very efficient with the cleaning. My teeth have never felt better and cleaner.

Reo Burt,"MY FAITH IN HUMANITY HAS BEEN RESTORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A little background..i had visited another dentist prior on a groupon because I did not have dental insurance they charged me extra for fluoride that Dr. Allison told me was unnecessary for me and also informed me that I needed 6 fillings, the cost (even with a discount for paying cash) OVER $1200I did not get any work done and left, in my head knowing that there was no way I could have that many cavities since in my 35 yrs on this planet I have only had 3 EVER!!!LET'S GET TO THE GOOD STUFF about the wonderful Dr. Allison....Parking was a dream, I walk in an am immediately greeted and given the normal paper work to fill out. I return it to the desk and I don't even have time to pull out my phone to entertain myself when I am called to the back...WOW Quickest waiting room experience to date!!!! A very nice assistant took my X-rays, then lead me to my exam chair to wait for the Dr (which I assume will be at least 30 min or more) I blink and my Dr. is there and ready to get down to business! Again I am pleasantly surprised.After the exam Dr. Allison tells me everything looks good but I have old fillings that will need some maintenance... AND we can do it today no problem I'M IN SHOCK AND AWE.... Pinch me I am dreaming.So i do NOT have 6 cavities???? WOW WOW WOW...

Siobhan Finch,"I feel very lucky to have found Dr. William Allison, actually through these Yelp reviews. I haven't been to the dentist in an awfully long time, so needless to say there was a lot of work to be done. I was terrified, shaking and crying coming in. I came out (and in for my 2nd appt) so grateful that he is so good at what he does that I was in no pain whatsoever. Recalling those numbing shots from my teenage years, it was enough to rip my eyeballs out. But with him it was all shockingly painless. And I say this as someone with a lower pain tolerance. He was attentive and listened to my concerns, and discussed everything with me. The helping staff was also so great at making me feel comfortable and explaining everything to me.

Sol Wickens,"Update: I did receive a very nice call from the Dentist himself, so they are good people who care about their patients, but I'm still pretty peeved about missing out on work and my $15!I would give this place no stars if I could. Unfortunately, I'd hate to jump the gun, since I didn't even get to SEE the dentist for my appointment.I made my appt. for 1:20pm. I arrived at 1pm, you know, get there early, take care of the new patient paperwork etc...and be on my way for a simple teeth cleaning.It was a hard road to get here, since I had to make a special trip out to the inner sunset on a Saturday all the way from Oaktown via public transit just to pick up my x-rays for this appt. Did I mention I had to pay $15 for said x-rays for the rush job? Yeah.So I sit and wait. And wait. 45 minutes go by and then I get some x-rays done. Oh yeah, my x-rays weren't even good enough. And I wait. I wait some more. I think I've read just about every People magazine in the joint and know everything about Michael Phelps and Portia and Ellen's wedding now.It is now a full 90 minutes since I've walked in the door, and my teeth have not been cleaned. The dental hygienist was nice enough, but to leave me sitting in a room for almost an hour, when I have no idea or hope of getting my teeth cleaned, really is bad business.If I had all day to sit, sure. I don't mind waiting. It's a Monday afternoon. Those with insurance usually work, like me. I had to get back to work. I chose this place specifically for its close locale to my office. This is what I get for trying to make things easier for myself because I don't have a car.I'll make a note to myself and listen next time I want to wander away from Dr. Jang. Sure, he calls me a carnie and has weird TV commercials, but he's always been prompt, has the best dentists and I always get free stuff and hugs from them.I can't speak for Dr. Allison himself, but my first experience with his office will probably be my last. I'm pretty sure of it. Now I just have to get my x-rays back!!!",2,Total Health Dental Care,"General Dentistry, Orthodontists, Oral Surgeons"

Lee Bartlett,"Going to the dentist can be like going to an auto mechanic. They can tell you what is wrong and fix the problem. On the flip side a dentist or auto mechanic can say there are things wrong to run up Â your bill and fix it. Either way I would not really know the difference as I do not know how to put in a crown, nor do I know how to install a catalytic converter for my car (never know if I am supposed to use or, or nor here). This is why I appreciate my mechanic (Xiou from XYZ motors) and William Allison my dentist. They get the job done honestly and do not tell you need to refill your fillings every few years just to make a few bucks. Yes, a dentist I went to a few times when I was in college in Davis did this to me and my out of pocket was around $500. Bottom line is William Allison is an honest dentist and I recommend him.

Rogan Naylor,"I was referred to Dr. Allison by a friend who knew that, as a grown man, I fear the dentist and am not affraid to say so. Â Dr. Allison's staff is awesome. Â They took me last minute, well, last 2 hours, but none the less, they were very accomidating. Â Their waiting room wasn't stuffy like others; with a view of the SF Bay, it's easy to relax. Â I waited about 5mins, but because I was early, and filled out the routine papers.Took an x-ray...EASIEST x-ray of my life (I hate x-rays, I always gag). Â Then I waited a few minutes for the doctor and he explained what he was going to do. Â He was gentle and VERY considerate of my dental fear. Â Every time I had a question, he'd stop working (I've had dentist who can apparently understand slurred English with dental tools in their patients mouths). Â He was very relaxed, not loud, and effective at working gently. Â The whole procedure took (tops) 5 minutes. Â **Since my first visit, I've been back a second &amp; third time for more work. Â Dr. Allison continues to be as gentle as before. Â I had a crown replaced and at the same visit, he did a repair to a chipped tooth. Â Today I'm going in for a deep cleaning.

Kobie Rodrigues,"I've been taken care of by Dr. Allison for well over fifteen years. The fact that I keep going back is probably all you need to know. The important thing, besides the fact that he's friendly and competent, is that he's honest. Some dentists see you as a cash cow with teeth. Not Dr. Allison. He only recommends what you truly need, and is good at explaining the tradeoffs on differing treatments so you can decide what you really want to spend.

Usually in all offices the receptionist should be the first person customers see when they walk in the front door and greet you with a smile, but NOT this one. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks but I disagree. If you are being paid to do the job whether you like your job or not, you have options, find another job or give this job your all and fake a smile if you have to, as you are not only representing the company, you are also representing yourself.

Skye Senior,"I was really disappointed with his services. I found Dr. Allison through Yelp, but I certainly don't share the reviews from 2008. First, Dr. Allison Â was unkind. Now I know that everyone has a bad day, but I went back three other times over a span of two years and I was displeased with his temperament each time. He was rude and condescending. He asked if I flossed regularly---which is obviously an acceptable question for a dentist to ask a patient---to which I answered honestly: ""not as regularly as I should."" Â Instead of encouraging me to floss more regularly, he scolded me. To make matter worst, I was disappointed with the actually services that he gave me. I paid $250 for a whitening tray. The tray didn't fit properly and caused me a lot of pain. I bought the trays right before my wedding and so I had added disappointment that they didn't work in time.

Jamie-Leigh Romero,"Interesting reply from this CEO who claimed that his business is very respected and claim that Yelp removed my reviews so it seemed it justified the continuing poor performance from their doctors and staffs. This year 2020 around June, I saw two doctors for the same problem. The first doctor gave me a wrong pill that I felt nauseated an dizzy after took it. The second doctor sent me to do blood test but he didn't tell me to fast. So I spent the whole morning wait in a line for nothing. After I done the test for a total 10 days I didn't hear anything from PlushCare for my test results , then I had to rush their customer support to get my test result. And they told me PlushCare has "" internal "" technical problem , they couldn't get my results. In all my primary doctors , none of these unprofessional , B minors levels skills and services have I ever encountered. In which medical system that misdiagnose is "" respectable""? And in which states , that delaying your patients test results won't affect the patient's health and timely diagnosis? Obviously You are the problem of your company's "" technical problem "". Quit bluffing on Yelp like a kid try to get revenge on your customers. It's obviously a Pathetic business operations if a CEO doesn't even care about the customer relationship and showed publicly.

If you don't believe me, just Google her - there are a ton of similar reviews. There was a mix up with my test results not being back yet (which was Plushcare's fault, they told me the results were back). She was incredibly unhelpful, ignoring me for minutes (presumably while she looked something up) without telling me what was going on. Then when I tried to ask her about some prior test results, she refused to engage and instead said to me - exact words - ""I gotta go, figure it out"".Bear in mind we were 5-6 minutes into a consultation I paid $100 for, but she somehow, ""gotta go"".

I scheduled an appointment at 10pm for the following morning. The doctor was prompt, listened to all of my concerns, and submitted the prescription I needed. I feel 100% better. Honestly if I didn't find this website I may have landed in the hospital with an asthma attack or worse. Thank you so much.

Falak Nieves,"Health form had a glitch - could not submit health history. Was given the option to submit the information later. I assumed that meant during the phone-visit. Sat on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes, the Dr. NEVER came on the line. I can understand being ten minutes late (which is what I was told) but not that long. I had to call them twice for them to issue me a refund; also beware of the reoccurring payments that you automatically agree to. Argh! Don't waste your time.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Nikita O'Connor,"3 Stars for easy virtual healthcare appointments. 1 Star for my Dr following up after the appointment. 1 star for not rushing the appointment main drs make me feel like i'm at a health of fast food, they just want me out of the appointment asap. I hate that. So would use again",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Macauley Riley,"I think I am going to add another star for the overall service because they have pretty good customer service.

Kaisha Harrington,"The doctor took my money then suggested getting a COVID test, and seeing a doctor in person. Â My advice to anyone reading this is to not waste money on this service.

Kerry Bean,No waiting a week or longer to speak to a doctor. The online visit was very professional and done in a timely manner.

Charli Burn,"The doctor I spoke to was great and professional. Â I am unsatisfied with plush care's services and their deceptive marketing practices. Â I will be disputing this charge and also contacting my insurance company to deny the services. Â I did a google search specifically searching for a certain medication. Â Plush Care's website showed up marketing that medication to me. Â When i spoke to the doctor, he basically said that plush care does not allow that medication to be prescribe even though it is a non-narcotic. Â This was a complete waste of time.

Farah Vang,"Their service is fantastic! Â This was my first experience with telemedicine and it was seamless. Â They have an excellent platform. Â Easy to sign up and register.

Â I give him 5 stars too!Made an appointment with Quest around mid day, brought them my printout with the order for the test, and they took a blood sample... sent it off to their lab.

Lenny Freeman,I was in a strange situation. I was attacked by bug bites I was covered. I am allergic to bug bites so I had a bad reaction. I contacted them at 12:30 Â for an appointment. Got appointment at 2:40 the Dr. was kind and helpful. I had my prescription at 3:20 and was on the road to healing success within 24 hours. I would use PlushCare again... no doubt!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Anand Woolley,"I am very disappointed by my experience with this service. I have a non urgent issue that can be easily handled virtually. I made the appointment, the website says get an appointment in 15 minutes. Turns out it was an hour later that a doctor was available, no big deal, I waited. They suggest getting on the call 5-10 mins early, I don't want to make anyone else run late so I got on 10 minutes early. 43 minutes later of nothing, no communication, no phone call, no message I called their 888 number. After waiting about 10 minutes for them to pick up, they did and said that the doctor tried to get on the call but the video or audio wasn't working. I was never notified. I was left hanging and the screen never changed, there was no doctor that appeared to try to get on. I'm not sure if that is just untrue or if their communication with patients is poor but either way I made sure to get a refund and will never try this company again. Luckily, they were able to email me a confirmation of the refund and that customer service agent, Meghan, was very nice. But alas, I am unhappy with the whole experience.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Sion Campos,"I was surpirsed how easy this was. I went into a place called Advace Care here in North Carolina, where the service was poor at best.

Â Very good experience! Â My doctor was great!!I travel a lot for work, so this was perfect for me and very convenient. I highly recommend this service!!!

Skylar Cameron,Had a bad burn Dr. Linda Anegawa helped me with . After 3rd FaceTime I'm 3 weeks she advised me to go to a doctor when I had huge improvements and cut me off of my silvadene cream for my healing burn . I feel taken because after my first appointment she refilled 3-4 times before requesting the new appointment . Also she kept prescribing me a prescription that was $300 and they had a ointment that was 270$ less we would request for and only got a response 1 out of 6 times literally . Service was great when I actually got the help . Should have just gone to a doctor once for $100-$150 instead of the run around i went through . I think it was the doctor . I would suggest trying another.,2,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Nevaeh Lancaster,"I have used PlushCare 4 times and am very happy this is available. The doctors have written prescriptions for me and ordered lab work. The convenience of this service is amazing. My insurance pays the entire bill. Â  **After posting this, I saw in another review that there is now a $9 per month fee for this service. Â It should be made very clear to the patient that this is a paid membership. Â I checked my profile and see that my credit card will be billed after the 30 day trial. Â AGAIN, this should be made very clear, and I cannot see that it is mentioned. Â I found out by reading another Yelp review.",4,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kayden Cuevas,"Amazing service! Super easy to navigate the app and I had an appointment with the doctor of my choice in a day! A day! My primary care can't see me until October and I got this awesome doctor in a day?! Yes please thanks PlushCare!I'd been dealing with an issue for a while and thanks to Covid I couldn't get the treatment I needed without waiting months...I did some research and was soooo happy with my choice!They take insurance (not mine but whatever)...if you're not covered you pay a $99 flat rate...if the doctor decides you still need to be seen in person for some reason they refund your money! Dr Marks was personable, professional, and made sure I understood everything he was prescribing and why...just a tip for people new to this, you should have a piece of paper and a pen ready to write things down and be prepared to ask questions! Also super helpful if you fill out the health questionnaire and upload photos (if relevant) prior to your appointment!By the time our 15 minutes was up I already had my prescriptions sent to my pharmacy and 24 hours later I already feel relief after 2+ months of struggling!I know $99 seems like a lot but I would have paid twice as much...don't hesitate honestly just do it! And choose Dr Marks he's my new favorite doctor ever! Love you PlushCare I'm a convert!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Sam Li,"I have to say this was the best doctor visit I have had. Â Dr. Riad Abdelkarim video call was OUTSTANDING. Â He talked to me in a very friendly and professional way.

Â He answers all my questions about COVID-19 and Antibody an let me know how we, noticed I said we, were going to proceed and how the follow-up would occur.

I was in a bad situation: I've had the flu and a fever for a full week (so was afraid it was something worse like pneumonia), and it's a holiday weekend, so there were no available doctors through One Medical. I'm also starting a new job in a few days, so I'm currently uninsured. All bad. Super bad news.I signed up, saw a doctor, and picked up my prescriptions all within an hour and a half. On a Sunday of a federal holiday weekend! And the doctor was really kind and talked me through all the possibilities very thoughtfully patiently. Very pleasantly surprised! I was afraid this would be a scam, to be honest.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Regan Brookes,"Beware that once you have an appointment, it automatically starts a membership for you which means a reoccurring fee every month. Â I had no idea until I checked my bank statement.

Cade Ingram,"This was my first time using this online service and I was more than impressed. The doctor assigned to this appointment was extremely knowledgeable and prescribed the proper medication which had an almost immediate effect. I was so impressed with this service that I have already recommended it to a family member and will myself use this again if needed.To sum this up, I would highly recommend this online service to anyone in need of same day appointment. It literally cost no more than seeing your primary physician at his\her office and you are not forced to sit in an office with other sick people while you wait your turn which anymore these days is typically 45 minutes or more beyond your appointment time. This Doctor was very friendly, courteous and on time.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Zi Perry,"I had a great experience with this.

Verity Hawes,"Plushcare was super easy to use and convenient especially with COVID-19 going around. The physician was nice and quick to send me a prescription. The only issue I have is with the system itself. When I entered my insurance info, I was told that I would only owe my copay, great! Then I was charged $99. After emailing the company, they said that because I have an HMO plan, it isnt covered. That is understandable and I'm fine with that. However, it should be conveyed to patients before hand. I would not have used the services if I had known considering i would have paid $15 down the street. And on top of that, if you dont cancel your free trial, you're charged another $15 I believe, give or take. Just be advised and make sure you're not paying too much!",3,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Jodi Lewis,One star . I had a very good telehealth visit with a provider (doctor) but after that my experience has been a complete headache.

Avery Simpson,"Stay away from this company, at first I really liked them. I really thought they were affordable. they told me my blood test was going to cost me only $118 which I paid them. then I get a bill from Quest Labs for almost $600 which this company never informed me it was going to cost extra. Before I got my bill from Quest labs plush care needed another $350 for three more tests, I am know trying to get back my $350. If I would of gone to Doctors On Call where I live they could of done all my blood tests for under $200. I had to do a online doctor because I was no where near my home town where I could of gone to Doctors on Call, with all the reviews I thought it was a trust worthy company. They tell you it is only going to be so much and then you get the surprising bill from Quest Labs. Once again stay away from Plush Care!!!!",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Marissa Larson,"It's obvious that you shouldn't use this service for super urgent emergencies like a broken bone or anything that requires an ER. But for cold/flu season this service is perfect. I was able to get a prescription sent to my pharmacy within minutes. Furthermore, the doctor I met with attentively listened and didn't rush me at all. Anyone who's seen a doctor knows that's not common. They were also able to call in prescriptions for my maintenance meds and an inhaler. Getting those scripts from an in-office doctor usually requires a full day off work so I can wait hours while they run behind. The support team is highly responsive and competent. When I had a request, they got it done within an hour. Using my insurance was easy- I entered my ID number and instantly. saw the right copay ready to go, no fuss. I will very likely be a long-term user of this service and I'm very glad exists.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Lani Moses,I found Plush Care to be an absolute rip off. They made a quick easy $99 off me. At the end the Doctor basically told me what I already know that I need an xray and ultrasound. He said to find an urgent care and go see ccx a doctor there and ask for xray and an ultrasound. He did not order any tests. Basically just bla bla go get it checked out. Take a laxative thanks for the $99. I DO NOT recommend this service.,1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Shaan Vance,"Very pleasant, quick and easy. Â I let my daily maintenance meds get down to a few tablets and called my primary care physician for an appointment and there were no appointments available for a month and she wouldn't write me a script for one month to tide me over. Â I went to google and found PlushCare! Â  I registered online, filled out a short intake questionnaire, paid with a card and had an appointment two hours later. Â I downloaded the PlushCare app and created an account (easy). Â At my appointment time I logged into my app and took my video call with Dr Saremi and two hours later I picked up my meds! Â He also emailed me a form with lab/blood tests that we decided I should have performed and once completed, the lab will email both of us the results. Â  Easy peasy, I totally recommend PlushCare!

Brooklyn Palacios,"I haven't had Insurance since 2004. I do the basics for issues that arise. Then came along a rash on the bottom of my foot. I tried to wait it out for five days. It spread to top of foot. Everything I read said nothing regarding the pain. Seering pain, wasn't mentioned in any rash info. I guessed Shingles. That stuff spreads. I had to do something. I live in the boonies. I went to the internet and found Plush care. Best decision I've ever made about health care. Dr Allison Lovelle. We talked I sent photos, the sign up was uncomplicated. She sent the prescription to the Pharmacy. And I suggest having the, RXCOUPON on your phone. Â The 206 dollars for twenty-one pills...came to twenty dollars with the coupon.

Charley Chapman,The doctors are okay but the billing is unorthodox. I know a lot about insurance and signed up for the 14.99 a month membership. I have excellent insurance MyUHC who paid most of my bill even before Covid. I met my coinsurance and deductible but they charged me 49.00 per visit. I called the billing department and the agent said only 3 people work in billing. Â I paid more than someone uninsured (god bless those uninsured). The agent was not a billing specialist and said Veronica - the lead billing person will be on vacation for two weeks.Basically they charged a contract rate to UHC (when in contract) say 200. Then bc they were a contracted provider less a discount were paid say Â 80 of the 99 charge under contract. But they still hit my Amex with a 49 charge rather than billing me the difference of 19.00 since each visit is 99.00 - son that's 49+80 so collected 129.00 UHC paid- was prior to UHC canceling their contract. I should only have owed them 19.00 but the agent said you owe a 49 flat fee no matter what. For a 23 million dollar IPO they should have more people in billing. Write the Ca Board of Insurance. Â She was wrong bc I did receive a credit or two but now need to audit my Amex and see what UHC paid. Â Incompetent!When I used them they were under contract with UHC. Â 3 people- and the billing is under Plushcare or the doctors name so that's tricky. The doctors vary but you rarely get the same doctor. I am canceling my membership. Â Be careful and know your rights. Long review but be careful- I am tired but hope this helps.,1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Andrea Rivers,"I absolutely love this service and wish I had known of it sooner! Â I paid $30 with my insurance and was able to get an appointment with a lovely Dr the very next day. Dr. Klenk didn't rush me and I found her to be very thorough and she had a great bedside matter. She has many years of experience in her own office and is highly respected! I was able to get a prescription sent to my pharmacy immediately after my appointment ended. It was also comforting to know that if necessary, the Dr would've sent in lab orders. This is full service and was done in the comfort of my living room in my pjs! It's great knowing that you can get a dr's appointment and see a provider without leaving your house which is especially helpful if you are not feeling great AND more so as this is especially convenient (if not necessary) during the Covid-19 pandemic.By the way, I am located in NJ and my provider was in Ohio!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Chace Arroyo,Absolutely the easiest doctor visit ever. Â Done from the comfort of my own home. Â On top of that the doctor was on time and was so nice!

Kenzie Whitney,"Waited almost 30 minutes for a doctor. So I tried to cancel or reschedule. Nope. It wont allow that. Had to tend to my kids so I had to leave the call. Got a call shortly after from the doctor. He seemed like he didn't care at all. His whole tone was almost like I was bothersome. He didnt look at my previous chart at all and if he did he didnt mention nothing. It was the most uncomfortable experience I had with this place so far. Sadly, I wont be staying. Also, you pay $14 a month after your first visit. I thought it was just the co-pay. Nope.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Murphy Dalton,"I used this service for the first time the other day. The process was so easy and the doctor was amazing and kind. She listened to me and refilled the meds I needed. I also got my prescriptions in record time at my local,pharmacy! I also received a follow up email to make sure I was satisfied.This is something I will use again and recommend it to everyone I can. They also billed my insurance for the visit and it sure beats waiting an hour for my local MD for a 5 minute appointment! Genius idea.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Quinn Walter,"So convenient and the Doctor I spoke with, Dr. Adonis Saremi, was so knowledgeable and friendly. I really feel like he cared and was listening.

Aoife Valentine,"When my appointment time arrived and the doctor appeared on the video conference on my iPhone (8+), we couldn't hear each other despite the app having access to my camera/mic and the volume being all the way up. Â As I fumbled to try to remedy the situation, the video call cut off. Â Then a moment later, the doctor called me directly! Â So we just spoke without video, off the app...I'm giving this service 5 stars despite the technical hiccup because I had been about to check myself into an emergency room and this doctor saved me many hours of grieve and a small fortune in medical bills. Â (Trying to self-diagnose your ailments on Google is a surefire way to feed your anxiety.) Â The previous two nights, I had been in excruciating pain for HOURS ON END. Â Through this 5-10 minute call, this urgent care doctor advised me to take some over-the-counter medication... and I had my first pain-free night of sleep.

Mylie Griffin,"Consulted with one of their physicians in March 2020. It was okay, not outstanding, but no real complaints. Paid for and done, I thought. In July 2020, out of the blue and with no notification, I started being charged a monthly charge of $14.99. Where did that come from? Had literally only had the one appointment with this business and no other contact. DISHONEST. Won't use again. Had to go onto the website to cancel a monthly charge which I never signed up for.

Robyn Kramer,"Their office staff doesn't even understand how insurance claims work. They don't care to either. This place isn't worth the hassle. Don't use this provider unless you want to spend two months going back and forth about how they are incapable of filing an insurance claim.I used them three times. The first two times I had no real issues. The doctors are fine. The third time they suddenly forgot how to properly make an insurance claim. I would expect someone to make the effort get on the phone with the carrier and have them walk them through the correct procedure if they don't know how to do their job correctly. Nope, instead they just give up and say they don't know. Their solution is to shift the burden to me so they don't have to deal with it. I constantly have to follow up with them. They just don't make the effort.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Hilda Witt,Cedar count is the highest since the early 1900's and I couldn't shake the sinus pressure and lost nasal drip. So I reached out to plush care thru my insurance and was able to get an appointment within 2 hours. Meet the doctor online video chat and told him what was going on he asked a few questions. He wrote a prescription I picked it up the same days and now two days later I am 95% back to normal just a small infrequent cough which will probably be gone by tomorrow. SO EASY AND CONVENIENT.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Misha Bryant,This is awesome. I was one on one with the doctor. He was very courteous and professional. I felt like a rock star. My prescriptions were called in ASAP.

Mira Juarez,Cost me a third of what I would have paid on Dr On Demand for the consult and rx I was seeking. Dr. Viereira was kind and helpful. I'm very happy PlushCare exists. Thank you!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Sheridan Phillips,"They are generally cheaper and a huge time save over normal doctors. Â However, they really need to get it together on their infrastructure for testing and reporting of test results. Â I have had an experience where the doctor doubly messed up my test order: first by not sending the order with any tests on it, second by writing down the wrong test in their notes, which meant I had to call back twice. Â Plushcare fixed the problem quickly enough, but I just barely was able to complete the test in time before the lab shut down. Â And right now, I'm having an experience where I'm waiting for them to call back and explain why they sent me a test order with half the tests I just got done, instead of just reporting the results, with no additional explanation. Â Come on, folks.UPDATE: According to their records, they called my prescription in, but the pharmacy never received it. Â Why am I not surprised? Â At least they got my test results to me after an unexplained hiccup.Finally, certain tests cannot be ordered by PlushCare because you need a doctor's office to do them in person.",3,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kiran Sims,"I tried PlushCare this week, and I was quite impressed. I have a telemedicine service that is free through my insurance, but I often feel like the medical doctors are hesitant to prescribe medication unless you are in really bad shape. PlushCare had a $15 copay for me with my insurance, plus 30-day trial membership, then $9.99/month. So this time, I had the flu for a week and developed bronchitis, I couldn't sleep through the night due to my hacking cough. Dr. Klenk was so upbeat and compassionate; she got me hooked up with needed meds for my bronchitis, and also sent a refill of one of my maintenance meds. This was on New Year's Eve afternoon...by dinnertime, I had already picked up my prescriptions from the pharmacy and was on the road to healing. I will definitely turn to them again.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Cordelia Henson,I was able to get an appointment within 5 min. Dermatologist was able to get me just what I needed and an RX for a time that will actually help improve my skin. My primary care dr. Online only offered a one week rx. ( not going to help clear up my skin) I will continue to use them even when I feel safe going to a dr. After is was so easy!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Tayler Paine,"My inhaler expired and I needed a new prescription, but I moved right before COVID and I didn't even know where to start with finding a new doctor out here. I gave PlushCare a shot and it was super easy, convenient, and fast. Like two hours after installing the app I was already done with the appointment and headed to the pharmacy to pick it up. Would definitely recommend.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Charly Knight,Dr. Allan Marks was excellent! He was very friendly and helpful. I felt comfortable talking to him. He filled my prescriptions in a timely manner.

Yassin Hogg,"I was one of the very first Plush Care patients. I have sent multiple people to them as well. I really was a real fan! But then they raised their prices and started taking insurance. I first submitted my insurance information and all went through just fine. Then a few months later, I was in need of urgent care again. I submitted my insurance info again, and the system said all went through. So I had my appointment online with a doctor, who just advised me to try to de-stress and drink more water. I felt disappointed in the session, but at least I didn't have to pay for such simple advice because they said my insurance was going to cover it. ... Then days later, I received a receipt for the full amount, which PlushCare took from my bank account; which they had on file from previous visits. I emailed them to tell them about the glitch and ask for my money back, but I got no reply. So I called and spoke with a woman who told me that there was no mistake, they purposely took my money despite my insurance. They said my insurance doesn't cover people like me, but they cover others for PlushCare services. What? She said I would have to submit tons of paperwork to try and get my money back through my insurance, but they would not honor the fact that they assured me before my appointment that my insurance would cover it. It is extremely wrong to do this to people! And trust me, they are just fine with doing this! Other people have said the same. This is immoral and wrong!! :-(",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Loki Matthams,"Such a wonderful service for people currently without Medical Insurance. Â The Doctor listened to my symptoms, offered up advice and ordered a prescription for me to be picked up at Costco the same day. Â He also checked up in the following days to be sure things were going well. Â My son, who is also without insurance, was the one to tell me about this wonderful service after he used it for strep throat.

Kristi Cunningham,DR. Allan Marks has helped my daughter two times and we cannot recommend them enough. My daughter has ADHD and can't wait in a waiting room forever. This was the fastest and easiest way to get my daughter diagnosed and pick up a script. Â One time we used this service when no other doctor was open. Plush care was available! My daughter didn't have to even leave the house in 6 degree weather (would have made her MORE SICK). She had severe sinus infection and Dr. was not only clear and nice but looked up holiday pharmacy hours ahead of time to make sure I could pick up the script in time! AWESOME! 2nd time went just as smooth. Thank you!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ayat Mcclure,"Great experience with Dr. Marino. On a daily maintenance drug for hypothyroidism. I relocated recently and everywhere I went, it was a project to get meds...and I work at a hospital.

Leslie Paul,This is such a great service. The doctors are friendly and very knowledgeable (as they were trained to be). I've used this app a few times and have recommended it to all of my friends. I met with a doc in my office and started the necessary medications the same day! This is the age of convenience and honestly it doesn't get anymore convenient than this.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Evan Mcgowan,I can't believe how easy this was!!! I didn't have the energy to go to an actual dr and this was life changing. Dr. Tina Wu was so professional and understanding. I will recommend this service to ALL.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kit Taylor,"I found this service to be decent enough. I was able to get an appointment in about an hour on a Saturday. My problem was not serious enough to warrant a trip to the ER, and it was lockdown so I really didn't want to go there anyway. The Dr. I dealt with was very nice. she gave me her probable diagnosis, and called in a prescription while I was still on the line. Perfect. However, their advertised ""low rates"" I think, are quite high. My oncologist only charges $59 for 15 minutes. Then after charging my card for $99, they billed my insurance $199. When I inquired, I was first told it had something to do with my deductible. What does my deductible have to do with what they charge? Then the second person I spoke to told me that they always bill insurance for more. Seriously? I'm pretty sure that's not even legal. However, the biggest thing I learned is that if you're Medicare, make sure you choose a provider that accepts it. They don't, and I didn't check that. This was a one time desperate measure thing for me, so I'm canceling before I get billed a monthly charge. Can't see any reason to pay that every month for ""just in case"".",3,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Kaia Hanna,"Booked an appointment to get a refill/dosage change for managing a chronic condition since I've moved away from my regular PCP, and the process was seamless. The doctor took a look at my recent lab results, confirmed my suspicions, and wrote me a new prescription right away. She also spent time thoroughly answering my questions in an understandable way. I probably spent more time with the Plushcare doctor than my own rather harried PCP. Plus, the labwork she ordered was extremely affordable without insurance. Would definitely use this service again!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Emerson Swan,Used for a prescription refill for my daughter when her primary doctor was not available. Â Worked exactly as stated. Â Appt next morning and picked up meds at my pharmacy that evening.

Bo Guerrero,"I had the best experience with this service: easily booked an appointment, had a visit with a doctor on my own phone, the doctor sent the prescription to my pharmacy, the pharmacy delivered it to my door.

Charlie Phan,"My primary physician is located in Colombia, so it's difficult to get a prescription refilled here in the States.

Christie Middleton,I had a positive UTI result from over the counter product I had purchased but wasn't exactly sure the result was accurate. Thought it better to be safe than sorry and was resigned to going to a local urgent care but saw PlushCare online and decided to try that first as the idea of being able to take care of it without leaving home was almost too good to be true. Dr Marks was very kind and helpful. The call started on time and he was very professional. He sent my prescriptions in as we were talking and they were ready shortly thereafter. I was able to start treatment much sooner and I love not having to go to a doctors office and potentially picking up something else. Will totally use the app again if I or anyone else in the family comes down with something that can be treated this way!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Harlee Person,I highly recommend. This was my first time using Plushcare. I downloaded the app and secured an appointment within the hour. The doctor was online when promised and was very attentive.

Kiran Levy,"This is absolutely the best service hands down. I was just about to head to one of those take care clinics and wait a couple of hours to see a doctor. However, I googled online doctors and this popped up. I'm so grateful it did. This saved me so much time and I don't feel well so I didn't want to get in the car and wait to be seen. Dr. Anderson was amazing. She FaceTimed me and Evaluated my symptoms. She was so nice and the process was so easy. Thank you. I will definitely use this service again. Best part... they took my insurance.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kiya Battle,"My first reason for using PlushCare is that it's affordable. I really wasn't concerned about anything else at first. Now that I have used it, I can say that I would and will use it again, as it made the whole ordeal of getting my meds so simple.

Willa Mccoy,I had an appointment with Evelyn Darius. This is the first time I ever used FaceTime to seek medical care. It was super convenient and the instructions were very clear. She connected to the phone call at the scheduled time. She addressed my concerns and was able to order bloodwork for me which I went to a Quest center and had it done an hour later. Follow up email checking on me was sent the next day. Recommend for minor complaints that you don't need to see a physician in person for. It only cost me $30!!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Amanpreet Parker,"This is my update to the dismal review and experience I had with Plushcare and Dr. Sarita Salzberg. Â In addition, to being extremely unhappy with my first experience, and determining the wrong medication had been called into the pharmacy for one of my meds. Â I tried reaching out numerous time to Plushcare without any results, I decided to go to their site and look for another one their physicians to help me correct this problem. I was able to make contact with Dr. Kristen Harvey; a doctor that clearly cares, took the time to go over my problem, and she corrected the discrepancy with the medication. Â In addition, she also took the time to discuss my other health concerns. She came to our appointment prepared, she had looked up my previous health records. She was extremely knowledgeable, empathetic and patient. She was astute enough to value my opinion and to inquire about my health objectives.She was everything I was looking for, but never thought I would find at Plushcare. Based upon her advice I was able to avoid the ER and/or Urgent Care, which Dr. Salzberg had recommended. Who in the heck wants to go to the ER in the middle of a pandemic?? I have a follow-up appointment with Dr. Harvey. Based upon today's positive experience, I plan to continue with Dr. Harvey and Plushcare. Thanks so much Dr. H.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Rory Mansell,My experience was perfection from beginning to end. Cannot say enough good things about Dr. Marino. She had a wonderful bedside manner while asking all of the pertinent questions.

Kendall Wilks,"Dr. Daniel Burnham was amazing- he was kind, understanding and prescribed exactly what my BF needed for his severe asthma. Will definitely use PlushCare again with him!

Madison Marshall,"I love PlushCare!!! I had a ruptured ear drum but I live near Tahoe and my dr is in Folsom so the elevation change is intense! Out of desperation I tried PlushCare and I am very happy! They switched my rx a couple of times and I also got a referral to an allergist for eczema. You pretty much have to know what's going on since they can't check you but all the dr.s Ive talked to really took their time and explained things to me and talked about what was going on. Today I talked to dr.baird for about 30 mins and he went into great detail about eczema and options he could offer me.  I will use this app instead of the dr office as much as I can!

Evangeline Lutz,Today was my 5th time using Plushcare overall. Unlike the previous times in the past this doctor was a straight up asshole and down right rude. My normal doctor wasn't available today and if I had to do it over again I would have most likely waited. Â Only reason I choose Dr Abedlkarim was for the high praise most left here in the reviews. I won't make that mistake again. I've been on the same meds for 0ver 10 years now and for whatever reason he decided after talking to me for under five mins that he was not going to write the medicine. Apparently my normal Dr and Doctors from my past were all wrong and would like to start me on something else. Â He would have to if I'd let him. It wasn't until I told him not to worry about it and I was going to end session and contact customer care and reschedule for when my normal Dr was available. By the way his name is Dr Benjamin Bowling. I would recommend him to everyone. I have to question someone who is so adamant about not writing a specific medicine only to write the prescription after I say I will just wait and reschedule. When just a minute ago you were saying how bad it was for me. Â Stick to your guns and if you truly believe it to be that bad your mind should not change.

I called to make an ob/gyn appointment this past Friday and wouldn't be able to go into that office until Monday. I thought, why not try PlushCare if I can find a solution to my problem sooner?I paid a $99 fee as my insurance was not accepted, which I think was more than reasonable for the convenience of this service. The physician I spoke with on the phone was so warm, comforting, and professional. He seemed genuinely interested and concerned, which is quite a feat to accomplish over the phone for anyone these days! They sent in a prescription to my local pharmacy and I went to pick it up, easy peasy.Would definitely recommend this service. And if you're not sure if they will actually attempt to assess or treat your problem, call the 1-800 number and ask! I tried to use them once before for a weird series of headaches I was having and they said that was something they did not want to attempt to assess remotely and told me I needed to schedule an appointment with a doctor in person.

Also, my doctor's medical receptionist had a ""don't care, so what if you're sick"" attitude.So this was the last straw for me regarding traditional urgent care. I find that they do not see your illness as URGENT and that they do not CARE.I turned to Google and researched ""Online Urgent Care near me"" and found PlushCare. I called and spoke to Rena.Rena was professional and proficient. I gave my insurance info, credit card, and other personal info. Twenty minutes later I was video conferencing with Dr. Lisa Dorsey: who was caring, diagnosed my illness and electronically sent my prescription to my local pharmacy.

Whitney Downs,"Okay, so....I openly and happily embrace my own witchy luddite techno-loathing anti-western principles of modality, that normally serve me oh-so-well, but I just have to say that I may not have fully drank the kool-aid, but I took a sip and have the mustache, and THANK YOU, Babylon and all your well oiled gears, for making my life so effen easy when I am feeling so sickly.I literally just booked a Dr's appointment, for within the hour (its 8:30 pm yo), as an over the phone consultation, from my bed... and will be able to go pick up an antibiotic prescription as soon as the call is over, just down the street. No clinics. No waiting room. No forms. No insurance bs. No florescent lighting and stressed out waiting room secretaries or freaking out that I have touched a surface contaminated with cooties. Just me, and my smartphone, crazy advances in technology and availability, and some lit candles and cooling tea as I huddle around my heating pad in my internest of comfort and bliss. I strongly recommend PlushCare. The name says it all. Affordable, fast, blessedly easy and convenient. And I don't even have to see the man face to face when I tell the Dr. I've been shitting liquid for a solid week.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Cai Jefferson,"I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience here. I typically dread anything medical in the US- Long waiting times, sub par time management, Sky high prices, you get this drift. Plush care is changing the game of medical care! Kudos to them for realising how to solve every negative aspect associated with medical care that plagues our current system. I had chest pain, set up an appointment online, video conferenced my doc from my death bed, had my prescriptions sent out to my pharmacy, all is well. Forget the cumbersome phone calls to make an appointment, the long wait lines at urgent care- download an app and voila! Great if you are out of state or out of country.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Cassidy Bautista,"I was dying.I could hardly breathe.9PM, sudden asthma attack, no medication. Â The nearest urgent care facilities were closed. Â And I hadn't seen a doctor in years, so I had no refill prescriptions.I frantically googled ""urgent care open near me""--and an ad appears: ""$99 urgent care over the phone"".I typically avoid ads, but not this time. Â (Thank you PlushCare copywriters and PPC employees!)I didn't hesitate to sign up. Â Within minutes, I was on the phone with Dr. Marks. Â He was cordial, professional, and caring. Â He even went out of his way to help find a 24/7 pharmacy near me--prescribing the medication without hesitation.There weren't any hassles. Â I didn't have to sit in a waiting room filled with contagiously sick patients. Â I didn't have to fill out unnecessarily long medical forms. Â And I had my inhaler all within an hour of clicking their ad.Thanks Dr. Marks and the entire PlushCare team!

Deon Avila,"Absolutely blown away and happy as can be!! After battling a nasty sinus infection for over a week, I caved and tried to get an appointment with my GP. No such luck; I would have had to wait another week for an appointment and pay $90 to see the--get this--physician's assistant. A week's wait just to see the PA...not even my doctor! Enough was enough.Initially I was skeptical and wary about Plushcare, but pain and frustration won out. Now I'm SO happy I tried Plushcare!! I went to their website, entered some basic information (name, age, and why I needed to speak with a doctor), booked a phone appointment for 5:00, and Dr. Rudy called EXACTLY at 5:00. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and caring. We spoke for about ten minutes, covering all sorts of information about sinus infections, home treatments, and various types of medications specifically geared toward my medical profile and needs. We didn't end the call until Dr. Rudy was totally satisfied that all my questions were answered and I'd gotten everything I'd paid for. The medical profession treating me like a human being? How amazing and wonderful that feels! Â :)We decided a course of antibiotics was in order, and twenty minutes later I was picking up my prescription at the pharmacy. Problem solved!! Total cost: $100 for the consultation (about the same--or even less--than a visit to a doctor's office) and about $25 for the meds, without the usual hassles and long wait times. Plus, you can pay immediately with your debit card right on their site, they don't take your payment until the consultation is complete, and you can select your preferred pharmacy right there with their easy-to-use pharmacy selection tool. A customer service agent even called to confirm my appointment beforehand and to make sure I was totally satisfied. Sweet!! Â :DNo hyperbole: Plushcare is just how healthcare SHOULD be. Fast, efficient, no-nonsense treatment and care without the hassle or bureaucracy or long wait times, plus knowledgeable and professional doctors who genuinely treat you as a PERSON instead of a number. I absolutely love this service, and I'm definitely going to keep using them for my run-of-the-mill healthcare needs. Best of all, they accept insurance and confirm it right there on the phone--no BS or double-talk, no up-selling or service charges, no ""just one more thing"" attempts to get you to sign up for a credit card. If Plushcare were a woman I'd marry it in a second!Plushcare might not be your best choice for serious life-threatening illnesses (you'll want to visit the ER for severe problems), but for things like sore throats, sinus infections, and other various frustrating and annoying conditions Plushcare is #1 in my book. Thanks SO MUCH to Plushcare and Dr. Rudy, my new favorite doctor!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Mackenzie Whitney,"Totally recommend! I had been fighting a cold for 11 days and I was over being sick and gave in. I went online at 4:30 pm, made appointment for 5 pm. Physician called right at 5. She was very informative asked great questions and really explained things to me - oh and I was driving at the time going to dinner. within an hour of my visit we are dinner, picked up medicine and was at home. Talk about multi-tasking. They also offer video calls which would be beneficial if I had to show something to the physician. This was super convenient and from start to finish was 11 minutes. About the same amount of time I would have had face-to-face with my PCP but less of my personal time being wasted. I didn't wait in their office 15-30 minutes before sitting in their exam room. A PCP visit can take about an hour in the office for 11 minutes of their time. Highly recommend!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Nola Goodman,"Developed bronchitis and was feeling terrible. This has happened to me a couple times in the past and was usually quickly resolved with an antibiotic. But I was traveling in a rural area with few healthcare options, so I went for a week to see if I could beat it myself. But I got worse and the only walk-in clinic was in the next town and charged $185. My wife found Plushcare on the web and, though I was skeptical about doing an online consult, I made an appointment. A couple hours later I was talking with Dr. Rudy (who trained at UCSF and Stanford). He was 3,000 miles away and I was in my pajamas at my desk! Dr. Rudy was excellent and concurred that it was treatable and within 90 minutes, I had picked up the Rx at the local pharmacy and had begun my course of antibiotics. Within a couple days I was much better. This was fast, efficient, and half the price of the Urgent Care facility. Even more important was that I didn't have to go sit in a waiting room with other patients (this was in the height of flu season) where I'd be exposed to who knows what. Highly recommend Plushcare and would certainly use them again.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Bryn Conley,"This is an incredible service. Â In the past, when I get eye infections I have to put up with emergency doctor visits, waiting rooms, coming in late to work etc. Using PlushCare, I was able to talk to a doctor and get the right medication in less than 20 minutes...from my bed! I made the appointment 30 minutes in advance, and it was so easy.Dr. Anegawa was super nice and professional. Â She gave me very clear instructions on how to take the medicine and what things I should be looking out for that would mean a physical doctor's visit would be necessary. This is my absolute go to from now on. Â 100% completely worth the price.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Charly Carlson,I am so glad I set up an appointment here! I set my appointment at 8:15 and the dr called at 8 am and it went super smooth. I've struggled with strep throat all my life and unfortunately can't sign up for insurance until November and this place saved me! We talked less than 5 mins and I told her I was 100% sure this was strep throat. She prescribed me antibiotics and asked if I had any further questions. Easy! I was at work so I asked to pick up my prescription near me. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't have insurance or if you don't want to wait in long lines to be attended. $99 flat rate consultation + $15 for my prescription (: ****UPDATE Dr. Gattu was amazing! After my first consultation I didn't feel any better so I emailed the Plush care team and they contacted me ASAP! The receptionist that called me was super friendly &amp; I wish I would've gotten her name. She told me to make sure I asked for an excuse letter for missing work and had Dr. Gattu get in contact with me to change prescriptions. I am absolutely blown away by the customer service and how much they truly care about your well being. I only paid $99 but all of my follow ups/Doctor notes were completely free. Thank you so much!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Dakota Harrington,"I was getting read to go away and didn't realize I didn't have any more refills left on my Thyroid prescription. I called my doctor's office only to find out she was on vacation, needless to say I was in a panic. I decided to go to Google search, to my surprise I found PlushCare where it stated I could get medication refills. I took a chance, gave them a call and sure enough they said my medication was one they could refill. I made an appointment for 3:15pm that same day and at exactly 3:15pm I was speaking with Dr. Marks who was very helpful &amp; so very nice to talk to. In minutes my prescription was filled and ready to be picked up in half an hour. I couldn't be happier &amp; would not hesitate to call again. Best part, my copay was only $10.

Chace Gilmore,"Had an ear infection from swimming at dog beach in OB. Instead of wasting hours at an in-person urgent care, and after doing the research to figure out there are not enough variables to need to be seen in person, called these folks.True, Â i spent $99 vs a 15$ copay, but I value my time. And did not need to drive anywhere.The doctor was kind, unhurried, thorough, and patiently explained both what she would give me and also what I should follow up on vis a vis having an MD in person check the ear drum, which is probably ruptured, in 10-14 days before I go swimming again.A well designed and managed stress free experience.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Tashan Atkins,"While the actual doctor visit went well and was helpful, this group misrepresented their insurance coverage. When signing up, I was asked to enter my insurance information. After doing so I was presented a screen that emphatically said that my insurance was accepted (with an exclaimation point). It turns out that I was charged the uninsured $99 amount though. When I called to find out more, I was told that their group doesn't accept HMO plans. These people need to make this clear before posting a message to me that specifically states that my insurance was accepted. The medical part of Plushcare is skilled and perfectly adequate. This bait and switch tactic Â does not speak well for the business side of their group.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Zain Goodwin,"The PlushCare model is exactly how efficient healthcare should be. Having previously worked for California's largest healthcare company, I've seen/heard of countless nightmare experiences in urgent cares. Fast forward and I haven't had insurance now for 3 years. When something came up, I was dreading the thought of going to my local urgent care, waiting in a room full of sick/ailing people for God only knows how long, with no real way to anticipate what the final costs of my visit will be until a bill shows up. I googled ""urgent care"" and PlushCare came up. I was skeptical, but the positive reviews helped (hence why I'm taking the time to write this). I paid the flat fee of $99 and scheduled my appointment with Dr. Rudy for 9:15am. He called my phone at exactly 9:15am. He was very pleasant and warm. He asked me very thorough questions- and I never once felt rushed or hurried along. Â  Â He sent my prescription to the pharmacy of my choice, and he also sent me an Rx discount card, in case the pharmacy accepted it. Within 1 hour, I had my prescription in hand and was back in bed to rest. Very thankful to know about PlushCare.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Aiden Perez,I just wanted to say this service lived up to their ratings. I recently moved from Boston to California and I haven't found a primary care yet. I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my throats area and in a little pain. Granted the sight made me feel worse than the actual pain. But I digress. I went searching for a doctor to see immediately and I found the ratings for this service. They are so attentive and helpful. They really listen to your issues and concerns Â and make the best decisions for you. They didn't just try to instantly prescribe me antibiotics. Which made me Feel very comfortable bc I'm always wary of doctors who do that. Dr. Dorsey gave me advice on what to do and to follow up within 3 days based on my condition and symptoms. I just wanted to add at the end of the call I felt satisfied and Dr. Dorsey really made me feel like I was her only patient bc she gave me all of her attention and I didn't feel rushed at all. I recommend this service and I recommend her as a doctor.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Robbie Hale,"After researching Urgent Care facilities in my area, none with excellent reviews, I came across PlushCare. I was in so much pain and the reviews were so good I decided to give it a try. At 11:25 am, I signed up for an 11:45 am video call appointment. Dr. Lovell was on time, very thorough in her questions, professional and courteous. Â She prescribed my antibiotics (agreed I had strep from symptoms and past history prone to it) and prescription was electronically sent to my local pharmacy while I was still on the phone with her. She also gave me so good advice on how to take care of my throat and what to eat while on antibiotics to guard against yeast infections. I had my first antibiotic treatment within 90 minutes of setting the appointment. So thankful! With just two doses the pain is reduced so much that I can actually eat again!

She asked me the appropriate questions and recommended me some things to do . I got my prescription called in and now I am picking it up. If it were not for this service I would have to drive all the way back to CT and see my primary ( that is if he was available) or worst yet go to a walk in clinic and wait for hours- uughhh.

Levi Hickman,"This is the second time I have needed a physician from Plush Care. Â Both times i am a highly satisfied customer. Â Both times i had initially contacted my PC office first, only to be told there are no same day appointments. Â Plush Care came through for me both times. Â The physicians i have spoken to were very professional, asked questions that made me feel cared for and concerned about, and gave me advice for bettering my health. Â TeleHealth IS indeed the future. Â It's almost the exact same thing as being in a doctors office talking with them face to face, you are just doing it by video. And they bill your insurance for you if you want them to. Â I paid the $99 cash each time, and for the service you get, it is money well spent.

Ho Montoya,"This is the best medical service I have ever solicited. Hands down and without question.I had been concerned about an inner ear infection that I had gotten during allergy season and after a week of having it without improvement, I decided that I needed to see a doctor. From the moment I DECIDED that I would get medical treatment from PlushCare, to the moment I had medication to treat my infrection... ONE HOUR.That's right. It took me all of one hour to make the appointment, meet with Dr. Rudy online, go to the pharmacy, fill the prescription, and take the medicine. ONE HOUR.I used to work in the health care field as a case manager for people with mental illness, and I have had my fair share of experiences with primary care physicians and urgent care. Recalling that experience, I have no doubt that clinics like PlushCare are going to reshape the culture of medicine in the United States. If I had money to invest, I would be pouring it into this company right now.That said, I am young, lower middle-class, and broke as a joke. So the icing on the cake of all of this... the price! The appointment and the cost of the medicine prescribed to me ended up costing less than $60.00. That is about equal to an insurance with affordable premiums copay for a physician's appointment. All without the hassle of booking an appointment weeks out, waiting in a clinic lobby and sterilized treatment room, and being seen by a doctor that is going to tell you what you likely already know.Oh, by the way... if my ear infection doesn't clear up in a week, I can call back in and get a FREE follow up appointment with the doctor.This service is AMAZING!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kian Kemp,"First off this review is for San Diego- I'm a mom to three kids, wife, busy lady in general. When I got handed a fever, sore throat, and chills I knew it was strep. Having Tricare (Military Ins) I had a few options. Wait 4 hours at urgent care or wait 3 days for an appointment, spend $99 for the CVS minute clinic and wait 2 hrs. None of those seemed appealing. I was nervous. Calling some 800 number to to see a doctor, errr talk to a doctor. As my pre teen says, YOLO so I call. I had my 'appointment' in 20 mins. Sent in pics of my throat, talked to the very nice doctor and he called in my RX. Ins covered my co-pay, so all I spent was $49 and never left my couch. That is priceless. I would recommend them again!! So easy.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Shah Dorsey,"On January 6, 2016, I decided to use my free follow-up visit within 30 days privilege, as I forgot to request a particular asthma medication prescription to be used in case of emergencies, in case the usual inhalers and medications don't work as they usually do.The night before, January 5th, I called to book my follow-up visit for January 6, 2016 at 9:00 PM and requested a video consultation. However on January 6, 2016, I called back and requested a reschedule to 9:45 PM. However I made a mistake and forgot to ask for the video consult set-up.Tonight, January 6, 2016, Dr. Allan Marks called me at exactly on time 9:45 PM. I was trying hard in vain to connect via video by clicking ""Start"" and he was trying to do the same. However the company did not set us up for video conference. Other than that, everything else about the phone follow-up visit with Dr. Allan Marks went exceptionally well!We had a very good 15 minute follow-up Appointment. My main reason for calling was because I wanted to refill a particular asthma prescription to be used in case of emergency, as I was thinking about visiting the snow in the Big Bear Lake area. I was really impressed with his very thorough and helpful advice on how to travel safely in the snow with asthma! I spent most of the phone call listening in awe to his huge amount of medical knowledge! He surely is an expert at treating asthma for patients of all ages, since he is primarily a Pediatrician, but also works with Adult Patients like myself. We also discussed my asthma improvements since he first treated me last month on December 15, 2015. He also gave me advice on safely doing my daily aerobics workouts with asthma, and dealing with the occasional pains of side stitches, side rib area pains, that come up when I exercise and breathe too vigorously. So grateful for the free follow up visit! Dr. Allan Marks is an expert and very knowledgeable Doctor, yet he is very polite, gentle, down to earth, and easy to communicate with, unlike some other Doctors that I have personally seen live in the past. Other than not being able to video conference with him, I was very pleased. He ordered a prescription to my local CVS Pharmacy, which I will pick up when I have time, most likely this weekend. Thank God for the great Tele-Doctor consult tonight!Next time, I will call instead of booking online my future Appointments, and specifically request video consultations. I think seeing face to face on our computers in real time would make this whole healthcare experience so much better. I have seen online articles on tele-medicine. But to actually participate in it has been a huge blessing to me and my health. Thank you, Plush Care and Dr. Allan Marks! You all definitely exceeded my expectations with your excellent Patient service, and you are a World-Class Doctor who truly cares!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Frances Sexton,"The doctor will see you now...literally.The MOST pleasant healthcare experience I've had. Opposed to waiting for hours in an urgent care waiting room with rude staff, you're tended to via phone or Skype! It's especially helpful when you've had your illness/injury before and just need confirmation and a prescription. Dr. Rudy was extremely attentive and he asked many questions just to make sure everything was clear. He didn't rush me at all and called right at my appointment time. He also let me know that any follow up calls after the initial appointment would be free, and to just make the appointment through the call center instead :) This is so incredibly awesome, and instead of going to an urgent care, PlushCare will be my go to. Plus - it's super convenient with the online booking as well. Thank you PlushCare and Dr. Rudy!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Karam Blaese,"Excellent! I work full time and I don't have a lot of time to wait around in a waiting room at an urgent care facility or a doctor's office when I begin getting familiar symptoms out of nowhere! I dread waiting around with irritating symptoms for days, trying to coordinate my work schedule with a doctor's availability and taking time out of my work day when all I need is a prescription. Yesterday I woke up with the early signs of a UTI. The first thing I thought of was ""Great! I will have to take 3 hours out of my day to wait in the Planned Parenthood waiting room JUST for them to prescribe me a pill"" I wished there was a way to just have a doctor call in a script! Well, now there is! Dr. Rudy was kind, compassionate and thorough. He listened to me, he asked all the same questions my primary care doctor would ask and he wrote two prescriptions, 1. a antibiotic for the UTI 2. Diflucan for in case the antibiotic gives me a yeast infection! Score! The prescriptions are E-Prescriptions, sent directly to your pharmacy and ready immediately. I did all this on a 5 min phone call and I was back to work in no time at all. I will leave at lunch to get my meds and go about my normal, everyday routine. Thanks PlushCare!!I believe this is the way to go for reoccurring issues. People with anything more than the common cold or common issues should most likely visit a doctor in person. However, I will definitely call PlushCare if my 3 year old daughter gets something obvious like Pink Eye. Sometimes there is no time to waste.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

PlushCare solved this problem, and I was given the option for appointments starting as early as 20 minutes from when I got to the site.I just concluded my video appointment, got my diagnosis and have a prescription waiting for me already.

I was about to give up.. then I discovered PlushCare and decided to give it a try.Dr. Rudy listened, asked good questions, and even took the time to check out the cost of what he was prescribing and direct me to a much cheaper pharmacy Â - that's NEVER happened in my in-person doctor's appointments. AND I felt that the quality was as good if not better than what I have received in the past because of the time and care that the physician took in understanding my symptoms.Will DEFINITELY use these guys again if the need arises Â Amazing customer service, easy web interface and scheduling, overall great experience.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rosemarie Ali,"Just like everyone else on here, I can't say enough about how great Plushcare is. This service is perfect for irritations or issues that you've had before and know what's going on. In my case, an ear infection, which I've had twice before and knew I just needed a course of antibiotics to take care of it. I schedule an appointment for 10:00am and the doctor (Dr. Wantuck) called exactly on time. He introduced himself, gave me his credentials and asked enough questions for me to know he actually wanted to get an understanding of what was going on. He recommended a week of antibiotics, as I expected, and said that if persists, I need to go to an actual clinic. He was kind, courteous and respectful, explaining how my ear infection could be linked to a previous cough that I had.Headed to the pharmacy now, a whole 15 minutes after my appointment time. No need to take off work or get up super early to go get in line at a walk-in clinic. Well worth the $45 for my time and energy. I'll definitely use this service again in the future.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Clarke Murphy,"I have used PlushCare on several occasions and LOVED it!This last time, for my 16 yr olds strep throat, the ball was DROPPED by Dr. Duque. He only prescribed 7 days of antibiotics for my son, on the 9th day my son says his throat is hurting again.I call up PlushCare to see if I can get at least 3 more days worth of antibiotics to equal 10 days, and I was told NO. Your son needs to be seen. so he has now missed more school because I couldn't get him into see his doctor on Sunday, and I'm down $450.00 dealing with strep.I don't understand what it could have hurt to have just given the refill when I asked. I looked up online how long amoxicillin,when taking for strep throat and everything said 10 days. This is so unfortunate because PlushCare has been great to me, I guess a good experience here really depends on the doctor you choose.I will not be choosing Dr. Duque ever again!!!",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Amar Schofield,"This is EXACTLY healthcare should be like! I'm so happy this business is up and running.

Â PLUSHCARE IS A GODSEND. I was able to book a same-day appointment with Dr. Marks who was very patient, and willing to answer all my questions. Â He was able to diagnose my illness over the phone and send a prescription directly to my neighborhood pharmacy. Â A few days later I was able to schedule a follow-up with Dr. Rudy free of charge to discuss some side-effects from the original medication. Â Dr. Rudy was also kind enough to look-up which pharmacy offered the lowest price for the medication he was prescribing and forwarded me a coupon. Â The doctors and the support team are super attentive, caring, and very professional.

Krista Dotson,I'm lucky enough to be pretty healthy. Â However it seems that my luck ran out this past Saturday. Â I was on the wrong side of a severe sinus infection that was only getting worse. By Tuesday I was thinking that I needed professional help...All my vitamin C and homeopathic aids were no help. That's when I found PushCare!!!!It was super easy to book an appointment. ...I think I filled my name and payment information. Â Within 30 minutes Dr. RUDY gave me a call. He was extremely helpful and thoroughly asked about my symptoms and the purpose of me call. I was feeling crummy and he made accessing care EASY!! I didn't have to get in the car and find an office...ALL I did was fill out and e - form and they did the rest. Â I am truly happy I found PushCare and I will definitely use them again.

The appointment was a good experience ended up taking 15 minutes of my time and I did it while at work. A prescription was imminently sent to the local pharmacy. This service saves time and energy.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Nour Pratt,This is such a great idea. Finally doctors are utilizing technology to help reduce medical cost and make care more convenient for the patient. I have insurance but have been using this service instead for most issues since I found out about it. So much better than waiting around in a doctors office when you don't feel good. And way cheaper since I have a high deductible insurance plan. I highly recommend this service!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ashlea Valenzuela,"Wow.We needed an urgent but non-emergency prescription for my 96-year-old grandfather on a Friday night. Â Nobody was available to see him until Tuesday, so we were told we would have to take him to the Emergency Room. Â That is not an easy feat for a barely-mobile 96-year-old, and causes undue stress that is not good for him. Â Not to mention the risk of him falling on the way there. Â There had to be a better solution.Enter PlushCare. Â The hard part was finding out that they exist. Â After madly googling ""Urgent home doctor visit"" and not getting much, I stumbled upon the Yelp review of PlushCare. Â Within 30 minutes of clicking on the website link, we were doing a video chat with a doctor, who sent his prescription to our local pharmacy, and another 30 minutes after that he had his medicine.A true miracle. Â This is the future of healthcare.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Manveer Calvert,"I just moved to this city a few months ago and haven't had time to even *think* about finding a new general physician up here.When I finally decided that this was not just a cold and needed further treatment, I first looked for traditional urgent care facilities...but not many of those were open on a Sunday. I then found PlushCare on good ol' Yelp (you'd think I'd have learned by now to just go to Yelp first...) I signed up, made an appointment, spoke to a doctor, and picked up a prescription all within a few hours of finding this gem of a service. And, what, only $45 and I don't even need to show you my insurance information?! Solid.Yet another thing to add to my list of why I f'ing love this city.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Thierry Whitmore,"I scheduled an appointment with Dr Reich, he was on time and all said and done, our video chat lasted 5 minutes. Â An hour later I was at the Pharmacy picking up my prescription. The app is easy to set up, the only thing to remember is that not all doctors accept all insurance on the app. I was trying to scheduled an appointment for about twenty minutes and I kept getting an error message. It never said ""insurance not accepted for this provider"" or anything like that, but if you experience the same issue, try a different doc and a different time. Â There really is no reason to leave you house anymore what with all these apps nowadays!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Killian Hebert,"RECOMMENDED: PlushCare brings technology to the medical field and eliminates the office waits &amp; bureaucracy. Â While not every medical condition can be resolved quickly, for those that can be diagnosed remotely, Plushcare provides a solid offering at a reasonable price.A basic skin infection was quickly dealt with. Doctor contacted right on time and Rx issued to local pharmacy. Doctor also was in no hurry and while the actual consultation was only 13 minutes, this is often more time than I get from my normal physician. If your particularly ""issue"" doesn't require lab testing or the physical laying on of hands, Plushcare is a very viable and more comfortable solution.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ada Morrow,"I suffer from a high frequency of sinus infections due to constant congestion and it's a horrible drain trying to make appointments on a regular basis to alleviate this. This is where PlushCare has changed my life. Before:I'd need to call the doctor's officeIdentify myself with very personal information, with a high propensity to be in an inappropriate place to be discussing that business.Get assigned a 20 minute very obscurely timed slot, since I'm completely miserable.Drive there.Park. Give away $15 on average for a parking garage that I need to drive to the very top to find any parking.Scurry into the appointment in a heap of stress. Talk to the doctor, deal with his guessing game of what else it could be.Get my script electronically sent to Walgreens. Drive to store, fight through to find a pharmacy, and fill the script.No followup, no satisfaction checks to make sure I get everything I need and want from a medical professional that is supposedly caring so highly about my well being.Now:Get on PlushCare. Login. Make sure the billing details are correct.Schedule a video call with a great doctor.Let him know my ailments.Collect my prescription and the nearest pharmacy.The simplifying effects on my healthcare process is fantastiche!

Andrea Villa,"Wow! I too was hesitant to use a service such as this, considering the amount of fraudulent and sketchy services on the web. But man am I happy as a clam that I did take a chance. It completely blew my expectations. The process was seamless, easy, simple and effective. I initially talked to Patrick in the call center, extremely kind, helpful and knowledgeable. Then I created my account, picked an appt time and that was it. The Dr. Wantuck called promptly at my appt time (no hour in the waiting or patient room), listened more than I believe many of my previous doctors that were physically in front of me have done in the past and went above and beyond in assessing my healthcare needs. I was floored as the ease in which the prescription for my cold was written and the doctor cared so much to say that he thought I may actually have another primary diagnosis effecting me, so if the first round of treatment doesn't prove to increase my prognosis, then call back for a follow up and he will access prescribing for the other diagnosis. WOW!!! I can echo Arcady S. about the solution to wasteful (time, money, effort) healthcare and how Plushcare is a true time-saver and healthcare advocator for getting a person better. Â I have begun to recommend Plushcare to everyone I know and will continue to use it for my own personal healthcare. GIVE IT A TRY!! You can't lose with a $45 fee!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Tate Simons,"PlushCare was a God send for me!I'm a mechanical designer at a medical device company in Carlsbad California making good money and paid $28 a week for medical insurance until the Unaffordable Care Act kicked in and then my rates went to $126 a week. I refuse to pay that much, and frankly can't afford too. My wife an i both came down with a lung infection back in February and she went back to work in Brazil and was able to get affordable care and was better in a little over a month. I in the meantime paid $165 at an urgent care and the Dr. there would not prescribe anything until I had a chest X-ray / CAT scan that was completely unaffordable. So I was getting sicker and sicker and didn't want to go to an emergency room, the last time I did that. I was billed $9400.00 something for 20 minutes. These Doctors at PlushCare listen to me and had no problem trying to treat me with antibiotics without first sending me for and X-ray. I'm getting better quickly now. Thank God for these doctors! $45 and I'm getting better! The Dr. that talked with me said that I didn't need to worry, if the antibiotics didn't work that they would find an affordable place in San Diego County for me to get an X-ray. All this took about 30 minutes on a Saturday, Googled affordable Healthcare, PlushCare came up in the search, book Â an appointment, the Dr. called, DONE!! Never got out of bed.

Wade Townsend,"As a retired hospital administrator and former EMT, I was impressed by my physician's questioning of my history, current symptoms, and looking at my back via my laptop camera to discern how to treat my sore back. I was traveling and it was not convenient to drive to an urgent care center. I didn't mind paying the reasonable fee. I was understood, listened to, offered alternatives and promptly given an appropriate prescription to treat my condition. After a few days my symptoms have subsided. I'm grateful for the care and the experience.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ingrid Osborne,"After dealing with strep for 6 days, I tried getting into another urgent care facility to get treatment, but they had taken their last patient before closing. I nearly lost it. I was in so much pain. I found PlushCare on Yelp and wasn't sure what to think, but I was desperate. I was able to make an appointment and was on the call with a physician within 15 minutes. My insurance covered everything and their system was easy to use. I had an Rx in my hands within the hour and just woke up 12 hours later feeling 90% better. Had it not been for their late night appointments and round the clock care, I would still feel sick this morning. This is a great service for folks in a bind - trust it but also approach with care. I could see the limits of online care for treating certain illnesses being tricky. I had strep and was so it was pretty straightforward.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Gia Best,"I used Plushcare once. Â When they needed my insurance information for billing, instead of just asking, they immediately mentioned a collection agency. Â Here's the relevant part of their email:Please include your insurance information below and, if possible, attach a photo of your insurance card to your email response so that **** can adequately bill your insurance instead of sending you a bill and then that going to a collection agency.Again, this was the first communication I had from them about needing my insurance info.

Tye Haworth,"Their website advertises ""get diagnosed, treated, and prescribed medication by top U.S. doctors from your phone now."" This led me to believe I could do a phone call with a doctor to address my medical concern. After spending 12 long minutes on the phone with a person who couldn't tell me if my insurance would be accepted unless I gave a credit card, I was finally told no doctors would be available (via Skype and not a simple phone call), that my insurance would cover. He then says, ""there's another provider that could see you, but you'd have to pay full price for the visit."" This did not sit well with me and felt like it was a way to make me pay more. Based on this experience, I can't recommend this service. Complete disappointment.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Henley Donaldson,"I've been having really bad allergies with awful congestion over the last month or so. I tried benadryl, waldryl, etc. but it's really just that I have no idea what is causing the allergies.

Fast forward to a friend telling me about PlushCare. I spoke to a super nice and very informed doctor. He sent a prescription to Walgreens near my office and also referred me to Quest to get an allergy panel done that same day. He's going to follow up with me when the results come back. Finally, I have doctors that are focused on experience and customer service at my fingertips. Hopefully, I don't have to tell them all my health history the next time I call...

Neo Glass,"Holy cow- this is the future of healthcare!!!I found myself in need of medical assistance for the start of Strep. I have had it many times in years past and know I need a perscription fast to clear it up. Â I went to yelp because I am new to the area and wanted to find an urgent care center. I was surprised by how low the urgent care ratings are compared to PlushCare. I did some research on Plush Care and found good ratings on many sites. I even called and asked questions about their unique method of providing healthcare. I booked my appointment, because lets face it if it was a scam I was only out $45.00.Boy was I surprised. The doctor was great! Even though I knew all I needed was perscription he was very thorough and we discussed new research on strept and medications. Â He looked up different local pharmacies and the best price. He even emailed me a coupon to save $10.00 on the prescription.I will be telling all my friends and family about their services!!

Â I found PlushCare through Yelp. The doctor was very friendly, asked a lot of important key questions to determine the problem, gave advice and some prescriptions.

She diagnosed my problem, provided measures that would help relieve symptoms and she prescribed antibiotics and cough medication. The prescriptions were sent directly to my pharmacy. Although I was skeptical at first, my experience with my Plush Care Physician was wonderful and it sure beats going to an urgent care where everyone is sick and running the risk of catching some other bug.

I suspected my son had strep throat, so I took a video of his throat and uploaded it. Im a nursing student so im a bit squirrely when dealing with strep as to avoid complications.

Elijah Cunningham,"Visiting CA from Hawaii, my 7 year old showed me his knee from a soccer wipeout that just wasn't healing after 4 days. Of course this happened on a Friday night at 8:30 pm. I recalled a school memo that had come out just before leaving that warned us about a few students getting Impentago. Uh oh.I felt 99% sure that this was our diagnosis - but was really hesitant to take him to the ER. In looking online for an Urgent Care - we found PLUSH CARE. After a 10 minute conversation to set up an account and email a photo to the service, a Dr. Marks called me at the exact time that was promised. I cannot describe how thorough and careful Dr. Marks was to make sure that my son had in fact, Impentago. He listened, asked questions, and researched pharmacies that could help at a late hour get me medicine immediately. Being in a remote area in Sonora, CA - it wasn't easy. I even called him back and told him that CVS was out of the antibiotic - so he found another one for us.I received an email with a discount code to give the pharmacist which helped since our out of state insurance was a hassle.Overall - I would recommend this service to anyone!

Lindsay Alvarez,"I called to either get a refill for an eczema prescription I have or get something better. Dr. told me to go see a dermatologist which I had already done like a year ago. She said she could not treat a patient she did not see in person?? Well if that is true then why did I spend $69 dollars for this phone call? If you are not going to treat me or advise me if there is something better then the medication I am currently using then tell me that upfront and let me cancel appointment and get a refund. If I had know she was just going to tell me to go to a specialist because she cannot treat me I would have just gone to the specialist and saved the $69. I feel that the site is misleading and I did not get Â really what I wanted. She did reluctantly refill my prescription for my current medication though. But overall I did not get what I expected from this service. And I definitely did not like hearing "" I can only treat patients I see"" Â Bottom line think twice about using this service they charge you upfront without really telling you what they will do. You are taking all the risk and they are taking none.Plush Care review update. I did just write a negative review regarding the Doctor call I received. The doctor stated "" I can not treat you unless I see you in person"" Also I was overcharged $10 from the price they emailed me. However I did receive and immediate phone call from Ryan the CEO of Plush Care and he apologized for the overcharge and not only refunded me the $10 but the whole $69 I was charged. He also explained there may have been some miscommunication between me and Doc because in fact the do diagnose/treat/prescribe over the phone or video chat. I told him if the doctor is going to not treat me and tell me to see another doctor than she should not charge me for the call. Be honest and upfront about it and I would have been fine with that. There was no mention of a refund by the doctor. Yes I understand that seeing a dermatologist is better than seeing a general doc for eczema but obviously this was a cost savings measure. Anyway I really appreciate the big time customer service by Ryan going above and beyond and making the customer happy. Kudos! Thank you for that Ryan. Be honest and upfront with your customers and if you cannot help them don't charge them. I would recommend Plush give them a try but if they cannot help you make sure they do not charge you.",4,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

All from the comfort of my bed! If you have an ipad/iPhone u can also do a face time(esque) discussion if you download their app. Dr. Garcia was very friendly and open to discussing anything.

Jamie-Lee Hogg,"PlushCare saved me at one of my best friend's weddings. These are top doctors available to you over the phone. The service is amazing and I can't thank them enough!! It is an incredible relief to know you never have to feel stranded without medical care again. Revolutionary.I was out of town and felt some horrible sickness coming on two nights before the wedding. I was coughing non stop, congested, no voice, horrible sore throat. The next morning I tried to call my doctor back in LA but of course he wasn't in, and my heart literally sank imagining having to endure the weekend feeling so sick. Urgent cares were closed and I frankly had no time to go to a doctor in-person because of all the bridesmaid duties I was still trying to fulfill in preparation for the wedding.Then one of my friends told me about her phenomenal experience with PlushCare and I could hardly believe it. I entered my info into the very easy-to-use interface, and a doctor (Dr. Sarbani Bhaduri) was available within 30 minutes. She called me right on time and I was able to speak with her over the phone from my car. She was thorough, attentive, and called in prescriptions and an inhaler at the pharmacy nearest me. I could hardly believe how amazing she was.Within 24 hours I felt so, so, so much better. As I was dancing at the wedding the next night, I kept thinking about how I would have missed this once-in-a-lifetime event had it not been for PlushCare. I have told all my family and friends and will continue using PlushCare!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Jai Goldsmith,"A huge shout out to Plush Care. Â I'm having some kind of crud for two weeks and didn't want to see a doctor because I didn't have insurance yet (new job). Â Then I found out about this. Â I had an appointment in 30 minutes, the lady was nice, the video chat worked ok (about as good as you could expect), she prescribed antibiotics, and as a bonus they have some kind of group pharmacy plan so my pills were 20 bucks. Â I wish I'd done this weeks ago. Â Oh, and it all happens in your bed.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Darla Holland,"I tried Plush Care last month and I am a convert. Â Emergency rooms receive calls from paramedics all the time describing what their patient looks like and asking for instructions. Â This service is for us, as patients, to be able to reach a doctor and get advice and prescriptions as needed. Â In my case, I was booked with Doctor in only 30 minutes! It is the ""everyday man"" version of the high-end doctor comes to your home service that only the very rich can afford. Â Plush charges are less than an emergency room and often even less than most visits to the doctor's office. Â Best of all, you do not have to wait a week for an appointment and then sit in the waiting room with every other sick patient for an hour.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rylee Brennan,"I was a little skeptical since there seemed to Â be only 5 star ratings, but plushcare was great. Super easy - I scheduled a call through the website 30 minutes in advance, received a call from a friendly doctor, and got my prescription sent to my pharmacy 15 mins later. My insurance company said I can submit a claim to get reimbursed for this as out-of-network urgent care, so fingers crossed that will go through. Even for the $69 it's well worth the convenience and cost of not having to travel to a clinic. This is why I love technology! Finally making a 15-min conversation with a doctor not be a half-day ordeal you have to wait weeks for.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ollie Laing,"So impressed by this service. Incredibly easy to set up my same-day appointment with Dr. Bowling to address flu symptoms. He was attentive, thoughtful and courteous.

Safa Jimenez,"Love the fact you don't have to lose half a day to go to a doctor office. I have used them twice this summer and have been grateful to have them available simply by picking up the phone or scheduling online. Very flexible on appointment times. I set appointment at 1215p for a 1230p appointment, the same day. I've been very happy with level of knowledge that has been communicated with me over the phone and no waiting around in waiting rooms with other sick people or sitting for several hours at an urgent care.

Arianne Fitzgerald,"Hello!My name is Kevin Brown and a friend Â recently told me of her experience with Plush Care.Funny and not funny, but three days later I felt congested in my head and sinuses so I decided make an appointment.....I Â emailed my regular doctor but no word......3 days... getting an appointment with the doctor would involve time off of work and time in the doctor's office.I'm one of those hairdressers thats booked out Â 3 months , so it would also involve cancelling appointments..... I went online and within two hours had a phone call from Dr Rudy.... We spoke for about 15 minutes as one of my clients was toning.... No interruptions no distractions and no cancels..... I was extremely pleased with the service. My prescriptions are waiting at the pharmacy.The doctor was very informative about sinuses and what to do in these situations to prevent it It was amazing to achieve something so quicklyThank you PlushCare!!Good Health All!Kevin BrownLet me not forget.... $45.00",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Blythe Beach,"I've never had a doctor experience like this one.... Wow. Â Blew me away. Â We saved hundreds of dollars by using PlushCare.... I thought it seemed like a scam when I first saw it online, and it turned out to be a WONDERFUL experience. Â My back went out and I needed a prescription for a strong muscle relaxer.

Kaia Crouch,"This is definitely an amazing service. Â  I had such a bad sinus infection and was in between jobs and didn't have insurance. Â Going into my local urgent care was going to cost me $80. Â  I was a bit skeptical about this but once I had the doctor on the phone, Â I was impressed. Â  He was very thorough on all of his questions. Â He sent my prescription to my local pharmacy right away. Â The doctor even asked me to call back if I didn't feel any better in a week, Â with no charge. Â Needless to say I felt better and started referring some of my friends to plush care. Â  I highly recommend them. Â Also, Â on they plus side of using them, Â you don't have to wait around to be attended to. Â You pick your appointment time, Â and they call you not a minute after.

Â I saw that Plush Care had a 5 star review on Yelp so I decided to give them a try. Â I'm glad I did, I had a great experience. Â I emailed photos of my mom's injuries to the doctor who called us and put our fears of a broken orbital bone to rest. Â It was quick and efficient. Â The price was great too.

Kody Rosas,"I LOVE Plushcare! I found myself stuck one day and the only clinic around me was an urgent care with an office visit fee of $120. I called Plushcare to make sure it was legit and I have used this wonderful service ever since. Plushcare doctors are helpful, patient and fast! I have had my prescriptions called into my local pharmacy within the hour of each appointment. As another reviewer mentioned Plushcare is priceless. I highly recommend this service. Your appointment is over the phone or via webcam and your medication is called in. When you are in need of antibiotics and you can't leave your home book with Plushcare! If I could give this business more than 5 stars I would!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Â After 2 weeks of my fiance having a horrible cough and me telling him he needed to go to the doctor and him ignoring me, Â we were at a restaurant waiting for our table when he went into a coughing fit. The next thing I know he was in a heap at my feet not breathing for a few seconds and came to in confusion as to what happened. I told him ""that's enough. We're not putting this off anymore."" I went online for local urgent cares and found this website. We didn't want to sit in a waiting room for hours so we gave it a try. For a little more than what we would pay for a co-pay the doctor called us got a brief medical history, Â asked about his symptoms, Â prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics. We even told the doctor this was a brilliant idea. HIGHLY recommend.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Dilan Yates,"This is such a shame. It was too good to be true. Â I had made an appointment the night before with Dr. Sinikka Green for an 8:15am appointment, and she NEVER called. I called the 800 number listed on the website, and the first girl said, she would call her, and that I should call back in 5-10 mins. I did, and some guy answered and had to start the process all over again. Then he said i would get a refund, when their website specifically says i would be charged after the call. A call that EVER occurred. I received an email refund stating my refund will take 10 days to appear on my statement. WTF? He continued by telling me he would schedule another appointment with Dr. Green later in the day since she was already booked. Are you F*** kidding. Why would i schedule another call with this looser doctor who never even called me. Instead of finding me a another doctor for the inconvenience, the caller seem like he didn't give a s**t, This is such an unprofessional service. I had the worst ear infection and had not slept the entire night and was looking forward to speaking to a doctor and getting an antibiotic as easy as everyone said it would be. This is false advertising. I will not be recommending this service to anyone.",1,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Pearl Schroeder,"I was travelling in California from Illinois in January of 2015. It was a Sunday and I was SICK! I had pink eye in both eyes, a sinus infection and a horrible cough. None of the clinics in Sausalito were open on a Sunday and I really didn't want to deal with driving into San Fran to park and wait in a walk-in clinic. The cost of the appointment at PlushCare was a flat, $45. If I had to drive to the city, pay for parking, deal with the out-of-network insurance nightmare, it would have been WELL over $45. The convenience of PlushCare, alone, is worth the $45! Then I found PlushCare. THANK GOODNESS! Scheduled an appointment online, VERY easy. The doctor (mine was Dr. Marks) called exactly at my appointment time (they can Skype with you, too), I mean, to-the-minute! Dr. Marks was really friendly and helpful. He wasn't in a hurry and rushing me to get off to his next appointment. He was able to diagnose me easily and my prescription was sent to a nearby CVS. Within 2 minutes of our call ending, I got a text from CVS that they had received my prescription. It was ready 10 minutes later. I cannot speak highly enough about PlushCare. It saved the rest of my trip. After I was home, I needed a new copy of my receipt. I emailed customer service and they sent that to me within 15 minutes.

Jagdeep Barker,"After no luck on finding an urgent care facility open in my area on a Sunday I came across this site online. I was hesitant, but I did not want to go to the ER for a UTI. So I gave it a shot and called. The doctor called me right on time and after a few questions she was sending a prescription to my nearest pharmacy! Â I followed up with my pharmacy and they had it! I was absolutely ecstatic! I didn't have to drive anywhere or bother waiting for who knows how long in a medical office.

Spencer Morris,"I had been up all night with UTI symptoms and by the next night I was contemplating going to the ER. I really did not want to spend 5 hours and lots of money sitting in an Emergency room, just to get some antibiotics. My husband had been looking online to see what we could do and he came across PlushCare. I was very hesitant and skeptical to see a doctor over video chat. I couldn't believe it could be that easy. I downloaded the app and chose an appointment for 6:00 with Dr. Allan Marks. I joined the video chat a few minutes before and right on the dot at 6:00, a very nice man, in his scrubs, at his desk joined me on the video. He went through some routine questions, asked me my symptoms,( when they started, etc)., and gave me an option of what he thought was best for me. He went over the antibiotics he thought would work best, gave me tons of information about it and before I knew it he was sending my perscription to the pharmacy of my choice. He said to call him if there are any issues or my symptoms get worse. I picked up my perscription an hour later and feel SO much better today. I would highly recommend PlushCare for anyone with a non-emergency issue and I would HIGHLY recommend speaking to Dr. Allan Marks. He was kind, professional, listened to any questions or concerns I had and gave me all the information I needed.

Reegan Hayden,"My regular doctor was unable to get my girls in until Friday. So I looked at nearby urgent cares. Nothing came up, but Plushcare did. I did a little research to see if this was reputable. Everyone gave it good reviews. So I made an appointment for my daughter. Paid $99. They promptly called me at the exact appointment time. I was able to tell them about my daughters symptoms and got a prescription for her pink eye. I also had my other daughter get a prescription for an additional $69, 2 patients! My other daughter also had ear pain and they wanted to wait to see if it cleared up on its own before they gave an antibiotic, since it wasn't hurting today. They said that if her ear pain came back to give them a call and the follow up would be free of charge. Great service all around. I'm so happy I found this!!!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Glen Preece,"I was initially a bit hesitant about trying PlushCare, but after I spoke with Dr. Rudy, one of PlushCare's doctors, I felt quite comfortable. My condition was one that I had seen doctors for in the past, so I knew what to expect and basically just needed a prescription. Dr. Rudy discussed options with me, recommended a drug to target my symptoms, told me which pharmacy in my area offered the best price on the drug, emailed me a coupon to use at the pharmacy that I chose, and advised me on symptoms that would indicate that I needed to see a doctor in person. So I was very satisfied with PlushCare's service and would use the service again.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Reo Taylor,"This is truly a wonderful service. Â So convenient and with qualified, personable doctors. Â We had been having difficulties with our son who was getting sick every month. Â When we went to our local urgent care, they would just prescribe antibiotics. Â When he got sick for a third time, we tried plushcare. Â The pediatrician suggested that we also try a steroid medication because it seemed to be related to inflammation. Â No one else locally had suggested this. Â After taking the steroid, his fever dropped dramatically and no antibiotics were needed.

Felix Dotson,"I don't usually give reviews but this is a special occasion, I was in need of a prescription refill and after atleast an hour or more searching online for a video doctor appointment I found plushcare urgent Care.. I'm in MYRTLE beach on vacation and forgot I didn't have refills on my gabapentin 800mg .. I thought I was going to be told they couldn't help but after carefully researching their policy they could in fact prescribe a refill 1 time every six months if they demend it necessary. I was treated with the utmost respect from the minute I called until I was done seeing DR. George Rudy , he is a first class top notch physician and the staff is stellar , it cost 99 dollars for the appointment and my insurance covered the 120 - 800 mg gabapentin in full. My insurance wasn't accepted by their office but it was only saving 20 dollars anyways. I got .. Off only my regular physician was as professional as DR. Rudy, I wanted to leave this review because I am a real person who got tremendous service and wanted to let people know go ahead spend the 99 dollars you won't be disappointed , they treat a lot of illness's not just refills but don't expect Â nerve pills or narcotics you won't get them ,I didn't ask but I know they won't do that, I looked into it cause I needed my nerve pills but I can do without into I get back home. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars I give the doctor 5 stars , the staff 5 stars , my experience 5 stars. Thank you DR. RUDY AND STAFF I WILL BE A PATIENT FOR LIFE WHEN I NEED AN URGENT CARE DOCTOR. ...

I myself have passed up medical care in the past due to the overcrowdedness and/or poor customer service. I'm currently sick with a sinus infection and it was very convenient to be able to speak to a doctor via phone and have him send a prescription for an antibiotic to my pharmacy of choice.

I live in California and was on vacation during Christmas in Colorado. When I called for an appointment for a sinus infection, they indicated that they could not help me because I was in Colorado and they did not have a physical licensed in the state. However, I got a call from the CEO within a few hours and he was able to provide me with a viable solution.

Phoenix Velazquez,"I wish there was something higher than 5 stars..... this company is above and beyond the best in terms of service and quality.I woke up with a non urgent but very painful condition on a Sunday morning. Normally Â if you get sick on a weekend and need treatment the ER or Urgent Care are your only options. If you can't get out of bed to drive there or your insurance does not provide good coverage for those visits you are kind of out of luck... while Googling for local medical clinics open on the weekends I found PlushCare. I called at 10am sharp, left a message and 30 minutes later a wonderful rep named Patrick called me back. He was so patient and helpful! He explained how PlushCare works and encouraged me to call back if I needed further assistance. I set up an account online (took less than 1 minute) and started to schedule an appointment but was unable to book for that day. I called back, left another message and sure enough again with in 30 minutes I received another call from Patrick. As he was not able to trouble shoot the issue he booked a same day appointment for me with Dr. Marks. At exactly the appointment time Dr. Marks (who was also wonderful) phoned me, asked me the right questions and called in a prescription to the pharmacy I had chosen. The prescription was ready in 20 minutes. All of this without my having to leave the house and all on a Sunday morning.

Jace Walls,"This thing is seriously heaven sent. My primary care doctor was not available any time soon and I just needed antibiotics. Before, I went to a local urgent care for the same matter and I was charged about 350 (and I have insurance too!) for the unnecessary tests they did when I knew what I already had. Making an appointment online was SUPER easy it was amazing. I got an appointment that same day and got a call from Dr. Wantuck like 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. He was so courteous and professional. He sent an online prescription to my local pharmacy right after our phone call. PlushCare costs $45 for the phone call/video chat but this is SO worth it. I could wait at home, it was fast and super easy. You can use insurance to pay for your medicine too.

He asked me all the appropriate questions about my sinus infection and previous treatments to take care of it, what drugs worked in the past and others that did not.And more important than that, he asked me multiple times when I had taken antibiotics last, not wanting to over use antibiotics if at all possible. Like any career, when you work closely with people, such as doctors, you know what to expect and Dr Marks and PlushCare went way beyond that.....What a brilliant way to treat patients, for certain conditions, at home and on the phone.I chose to pay this low fee, instead of driving back to the hospital I work at, going to ER and getting all that for free.......That say's volumes about how I feel regarding PlushCare.Great Job to all involved, it's about time!Neal E.

Doctor called exactly on scheduled time. She was great, not in a rush, asked lots of pertinent questions about my medical history and my concerns/ ailment (bronchitis/coughing/wheezing/headache). Listened to any of my additional questions and diagnosed me..Called in my meds while on phone and confirmed. Explained meds and why she recommended them for my illness. All done from the comfort of my bed!! Â Had my meds in hand and taking first dose by 730pm! Done! All for about the same cost as a copay and about a fourth the time, energy, and hassle. My only other alternative would've been urgent care changing $110 just for the office visit and I would've still been in the waiting room by the time I was already done and taking my first dose of antibiotic! My doctor couldn't fit me in till the following week (after New Year's). Needless to say, I felt much better and was able time work next shifts and telling everyone at my New Year's Eve party about this amazing new service I found! Â I am now your biggest evangelist and loyal patient. Here's hoping I don't need you in the New year! Cheers Plush Care! :-)",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Etienne Carpenter,"I love this very efficient, easy to use service! I was having painful urination and was for sure I had UTI. Dr. Rudy asked me questions and was very thorough and had excellent listening skills. In a matter of minutes, I recieved a phone call from my pharmacy stating my prescription was ready for pickup!!! I didn't have to get dressed and leave the house, everything was done over the phone! I love love love PlushCare!!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Avi O'Reilly,"Awesome! Total convenience. I was going to go to an urgent care, but dread the waits. For the same price with my insurance, I was able to talk to a doctor, and get an antibiotic for my sinus problem. So glad I found them.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Remy Bostock,"This place is great! Made an appointment, spoke with a doctor, got a prescription filled,In 2 hours total time on a Sunday for $45, compared to half a day and $2000 in ER the last time I needed weekend care.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Arlo Kumar,PlushCare provides a great service and I'm so happy urgent care is moving towards this model. Â This is super efficient and I couldn't be happier.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rikki Medrano,"My husband woke up with a really bad cold and was supposed to leave out of town on business that night. Â With no time to get into the doctor or run to an urgent care, we tried PlushCare and it worked out perfect. Â The doctor called right on time, talked with my husband about his symptoms, diagnosed his condition and immediately called in a prescription to our local pharmacy. Â Within 1 hour my husband had his meds in hand and was on his way to recovery. Â I will continue to use PlushCare and will recommend it to friends! Â No more long waits at the doctor's office or an urgent care...thanks PlushCare!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kai Penn,"Great experience! I'm new to Plush Care. A friend passed along info about their recent Indiegogo campaign and I contributed, which got me a membership. I used it the other day for the first time and was not disappointed -- in fact, I was impressed! I usually get a sinus infection at least once a year and have to take an annoying trip to the doctor's office just to get a prescription for something I already know I have. I decided to give Plush Care a shot and it was way more convenient. In the end, I got the prescription I needed without the hassle. Looking forward to more visits.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Brooke Mckenna,"Wow. I thought things like this were to good to be true. I received excellent service from friendly people. Dr Wantuck was professional very knowledgeable and solved my problem. I was apprehensive that this place was in some way a ""scam"". After much research it decided to try it. I logged in at 9 am and signed up. I chose an appointment for 11:30 am. I had pink eye within minutes Dr Wantuck emailed and asked me to send pics. I did. We had a 5-10 minute call. He then sent a Rx to my pharmacy. Â I sat on hold longer with Palo Alto medical then it took for my pink eye problem to get resolved with Plushcare. After sitting on hold more than 15 minutes with Palo Alto medical only told that I could get an appointment 8 to 9 hours later for 5:20 pm. Â I decided to try plushcare out!! Â I was literally amazed by plushcare!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Che Rasmussen,"This service is amazing. I have insurance but this was may more convenieng and considering the time I would have lost driving to the doctor's office and time at work, this was probably cheaper. I recieved a call Â at exactly 9:30,which was when I scheduled my appointment and was done within 5 minutes. My prescription was sent electronically to my local pharmacy and I Â am all set. If you can't Â wait to see a doctor, check this place out. 10/10 will use again.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rebekah Denton,"I found out about this through a medical question I asked online. It almost sounded too good to be true, but for $99 and to not have to leave my house in the pain I was in was amazing. As a veteran, I'm typically treated by the VA hospital which can take months for appointments and takes me an hour and a half to drive to. So needless to say, an appointment with a doctor over the phone sounded perfect.My appointment was with Dr. Jamie Nuwer and she couldn't have been more amazing. She sounded caring (unlike the majority of the VA doctors), she was extremely knowledgable (she offered a few suggestions based on my symptoms), and the entire conversation was so smooth and easy that I almost didn't believe it.The only setback was the prescriptions. I looked at the website where they listed on a map the available pharmacies in my area. I set the closest one as my pharmacy which is in the next town over. Dr. Nuwer sent the prescription over and I began heading that way. When I got there, I found out that grocery store had no pharmacy. I called to verify the address it was sent to and I was in the right place. I explained that this grocery store has no pharmacy (so where did my prescription go...?) and as far as I know, this brand doesn't have pharmacies at any location. I was told the grocery stores themselves would have to update their website/listing and it would be updated with Plush. Confused, I gave the person the information for the pharmacy I usually use and they sent the prescription there (this pharmacy was not on their interactive map but the brand logo was at the bottom of the page). The prescription was called in and I had the medications about an hour later. Overall, I would definitely recommend this service, however, I would also recommend some updates on the website so people like me aren't driving from city to city looking for where our prescriptions went. Pay the $99, and just verify the pharmacy ahead of time.",4,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Cleo Haley,"Hands down the best medical experience I have had in twenty years. Â Professional, attentive, and truly affordable. Â No hidden costs the price is the price. Â  I had a small conflict with the pharmacy and in one phone call PlushCare resolved the issue on the spot. Truly nice folks. Â Thanks Dr. Nuwer, may your Frisbee's fly straight and true...Paul Hancock satisfied customer and grateful patient.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Sidney Coles,This is a telemedicine clinic and I think they should change their name to reflect that since they don't have a physical office. That can be a problem when you show up for urgent care with a bleeding hand. So then I found myself trying to get to a real urgent clinic across town where I could be treated in person.,3,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rhian Clifford,"Plush Care Urgent Care is amazing! I cannot say enough to express how easy and convenient it is to use. The reason I am writing this review is because I fell ill just a few weeks back and I did not have a car to drive down to the doctor. I was debating on whether I should walk to the doctor or just hope I would feel better soon, but then I remembered my company had signed up for Plush Care. I scheduled an appointment and was quickly able to diagnosed by a doctor. The doctor was really nice and asked, what seemed to me to be, all the right questions. I will definitely use this service again and recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to leave their bed when they are sick (I think that is pretty much everyone).",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ciaran Mcgregor,"I signed up for Plush Care because getting into my regular doctors office can take up to a week. Â The ability to use this service instead of waiting to get into the regular doctors office is amazing. It is allergy season and I am very prone to sinus infections. Â When I get them, it takes me out. The pain and pressure in my sinuses is awful. Â I recommend Plush Care to everyone to use. Â I have had great experience with their service and will continue to use them moving forward!! The doctors take their time to listen without rushing you. Â I am so happy to know I have Plush Care as a option for all my medical needs!!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Everly Graves,"I came across PlushCare while searching for urgent care options in Oak Harbor, Ohio. I was not necessarily looking for treatment during my call. Instead I was primarily calling to determine whether I needed immediate medical care for a set of symptoms that could have possibly related to a serious medical condition. I tried getting in to see several local doctors with no luck that day, so this seemed a convenient and viable alternative. The scheduling process was easy (though be aware that the time zones on the schedule may be for CA time and not your own) and I received a call promptly at my scheduled time. So far, so good.But what REALLY amazed me was the quality of the interaction between my doctor and me. He listened carefully and didn't rush me at all. He asked questions directly related to my specific concerns. Once I finished presenting my symptoms and concerns, he asked great questions. I've noticed often that doctors do not pick up on nuances or listen carefully and end up jumping to conclusions instead.After I finished sharing my symptoms, Dr. Wantuck summarized which of my symptoms concerned him and which did not. Since I was trying to evaluate how serious my symptoms were, this was extremely helpful. He was sensitive, compassionate, and I could tell that he was taking my situation seriously.Being candid, I will say that I had a high level of skepticism about the online doctor experience. I questioned the credentials of the doctors that would provide service this way, and didn't expect such a satisfying, professional experience. I have recommended PlushCare to many friends and family since my first experience and will certainly use the service again in the future.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Nel Steadman,I was in so much pain from a UTI without a doctor because of my new insurance. I would have had to wait until my appt. in November or go to the emergency room. We all know how horrible that is. I was searching the web for urgent care and found PlushCare. Got an appt. 45 minutes after going online. Had my prescription for antibiotics by 11:30 am the same day. My insurance covered the cost!,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Kenzie Correa,"When my girlfriend had an urgent problem that could be fixed with some antibiotics on a Saturday night she asked me if I could help make an appointment with somebody to help prescribe something quickly. When I searched for local clinics I found none were open on Sunday. Then I searched for 'urgent care clinics' and found a listing for some 'housecall' doctors agencies for a pretty high fee, such as $400+ on a weekend, I saw a listing for PlushCare. After seeing some of the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try it. It was going to be under $100 (more like $70 with an online coupon) for a phone appointment the next morning with a woman doctor, whom my girlfriend preferred for this consultation, Dr. Jamie Nuwer. Dr. Nuwer called a little ahead of time, and left a message, because she had a bit of an opening, but we couldn't take the message. But she called back precisely at 10:00 AM, and proceeded to listen very carefully to my girlfriend's problem and requirements and prescribed the exact medications she needed. The prescription was sent electronically to a nearby CVS, and everything was handled with so much professionalism and speed it was quite amazing. My girlfriend and I still cannot get over how convenient this service was. I called it the Uber of healthcare, and I believe it's going to catch on like wildfire and revolutionize the industry. The only thing I would advise is to double-check the pharmacy that you are going to pick them up, because there are so many pharmacy chains within a particular area (this was San Francisco) that we actually went to a pharmacy which we thought was the one but it was the actually the same chain but a couple of blocks down on the same street. Not a big deal but just be careful of the exact location where the prescription was sent. 2 thumbs up!!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Hareem Horne,"Wonderful service, Dr. Marks is amazing. This was my first time trying this service out. I was on line searching for urgent care for my issues with fever cough and chest tightness. That had been lingering for 5 days. I came across plush care and though how innovative what an amazing way to cut down on ER visits and waiting in line in urgent care or even scheduling those appts with your primary care provider that can take days or up to weeks to be seen. The doctor called me at the exact time I was scheduled for gave me a diagnosis and called in a prescription to my pharmacy. This is by far the best thing in healthcare. Cost effective, fast and convenient. Thanks Plus care! you deserve more stars.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Jeevan Duggan,Plush care is the best thing since sliced breadMy 7 year old is sick and infection in both eyes.I called and immediately a doctor called me back.I had a prescription waiting for me at my pharmacy in no time.

Jaidan Ramirez,"I am thrilled. Â Our closest Urgent Care office on a Sunday is 40 minutes away. Â I called, a real person answered all Â my questions about this new type of medical service, and I was able to get a phone appointment 10 minutes later.

I really don't know what to say, I am super impressed.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Alyx Nash,"I talked to a plushcare doctor for routine gum infection. Â Consultation was quite short, about 3 minutes, and cost me $99. Â Doctor gave me prescription for a bottle of anti-biotic which cost $85!!! Â Totally un-necessary. Â In prior case of gum infection, I got prescription from a live dentist for amox, which cost just $10. Â  Overall, Plush care is fast, but not cost effective. Â There are other online doctor prescription service which is half the cost of plushcare.",2,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Krista Justice,"The worst feeling in the world has to be a tie between either 1) waking up and hopping out of bed only to fall to the floor with crippling dizziness and nausea or 2) calling your doctor after said wake up and being told that they just don't have time to see you today, sorry. Â After waiting a few hours vainly hoping for a cancellation at my dr's (to no avail of course) I went online to schedule an appt with PlushCare at around 2:55 pm. Â The first available appt was with Dr. Rudy at 3:30 pm, and I booked it. Â He called at exactly 3:30 pm. Â He was so pleasant, professional, and helpful. Â I can't say enough good things about this experience. Â He spent almost fifteen minutes on the phone with me and went over everything about my symptoms. Â He explained that I most likely had either a viral infection or strep throat, and prescribed me a strep throat antibiotic. Â My husband was able to pick it up on his way back from work, and within 30 minutes of taking the meds, I was feeling better than I had all day. Â WOW. Â All that, and I didn't even have to feel self conscious because I was too nauseous to stand upright long enough to do my hair and makeup. Best experience ever! Â I'm so grateful to Dr. Rudy and PlushCare, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ashanti Foley,"The is a fantastic service. Â I was looking at waiting 2 to 3 hours in an urgent care waiting room full of sick people, found Plush Care out of desperation and was very impressed with how easy it was to use, they took my insurance and prescribed over the phone what I needed for my illness. Â Doctor was well qualified, professional, asked all the right questions. Â I would use this service again and recommend it to my family and friends. Â Only issue is the video link instructions did not work but we were able to handle everything in the phone call. Â Only had to wait 30 minutes for the call.",4,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Shola Camacho,"This service is freaking awesome. Â Dr Gattu called exactly on time (doctors are never on time). She was super nice and spent more time talking than I usually get from a dr visit. Â Why go to a clinic and wait an hour I a waiting room full of sick people to see s doc for 90 seconds only to have them write a simple script and say see you later. Â I was pretty skeptical at first of not being seen in person but I am a believer. Â I would not use this service for anything serious, but for my bronchial infection, it was a simple script for antibiotics without the driving and waiting.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Ty Johnston,"So, I was dealing with a flare up of a recurrent skin condition ( folliculitis ) and needed my usual antibiotics however this time my primary doctor refused to call in a refill and told me to see a specialist, But that wasn't going to happen do to the fact that i was so uncomfortable and needed immediate medication which could not wait, So i began looking for other options and came across plushcare and decided to give them a try. I made an appointment with Dr George Rudy. Dr Rudy called me right on time and and was very attentive and knowledgeable. We spent about 10 minutes on the phone during which Dr Rudy asked questions to try to determine the proper treatment. I felt the level of service was equivalent to what would be received during a regular doctors visit. Â Dr Rudy ended up sending a prescription for my medications electronically to my pharmacy and gave me a list of nearby clinics and a prescription discount . I think this service is a great idea and i definitely will be using them again in the future !",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Flynn Greenaway,"I had been sick for a few days, but it got considerably worse after 3 pm. Â I was at work and couldn't leave to see my primary care physician and due to an evening work commitment, I couldn't wait it out at an urgent care. Â I found this service online and was able to make an appointment within 20 minutes of completing the very easy sign-up process. Â Dr. Wantuck called me at my exact appointment time. Â He was thorough in his questions about my condition as well as my medical history. Â Dr. Wantuck prescribed a medication and immediately called it in after the phone call was complete to my local pharmacy. Â He ordered additional tests and emailed the orders to me. Â They use a national lab chain and it was very easy to have my tests done. I was very impressed that he asked me about my medical insurance so that my prescription and tests would be covered. He nailed the diagnosis and I was symptom free in three days. Â I was able to access my test results online and I had a question about a particular result. Â I called the 800 number and Patrick promptly returned my voice mail. Â Within 30 minutes, Dr. Wantuck called me and he answered all of my questions. Â Best of all, the follow-up call was free! Â While the initial ""visit"" is $99, an established patient's next call is $69. Â For the high level of service delivered, it was well-worth the cost. Â I will recommend this service to my own family and will definitely use it again when I am unable to see my primary care physician. Â Candidly, I would give Plush Care six stars if Yelp had them!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Lennox Halliday,Wonderful care.Woke up in the middle of the night with a UTI and was googling 24 hour urgent cares.Up popped Plushcare and I made an immediate appt. for the morning.Doctor called right on time and was able to help me very quickly.He even emailed me a coupon and my medication was 1/2 the usual cost.I can't say enough good things about his demeanor and how he took the time to listen.I liked him much more than the doctor I had when I had insurance.I was a little hesitate at first because I'd never heard of Plushcare before but they have won me over.,5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Casey Mitchell,"This is my third time using plush care (twice for my fiancee and this time for myself). I'm more than impressed. The service is great and very well set up. I came down with a rapidly progressing infection that went to my kidneys and I had some scary symptoms. I tried getting into several places to be seen and hit tons of stops.

From really nasty symptoms, I'm now normal again!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Toni Dunn,"We had a great experience: Sunday morning we went online and selected the exact time we wanted an appointment: Appointments were available every 15 minutes with about a 45-minute wait, and I believe that there was a choice between video (not sure using what software, we didn't select this) and phone. The MD (no PAs, as one would see at an in-person urgent-care clinic!) then called us at exactly that time. Even though we just needed a simple refill for on ongoing prescription that we had not gotten around to refilling on time, she was very thorough and asked plenty of questions, etc. Prescription was called into the pharmacy, done! The receipt that they sent us looks weirdly simple, so we'll see if our insurance accepts this for reimbursement or if we will need something else -- so long as there is no problem with insurance, we will DEFINITELY use this the next time we need urgent care and a physical exam is not needed.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Levi Summers,"My wife came home from work not feeling well at all. I decided to look online for the local Urgent Care. Plush Care was on the same page. We decided to call and just check it out. After talking to them we made an appointment. Dr Rudy called my wife right on time. What's with that??? You never get to see a Dr at the time of an appointment. You sit in a little waiting room with sick people waiting to go to a smaller room to wait. This was great. My wife felt at ease with Dr Rudy as he was very easy to talk to. He was also very thorough with his questions. Â We will use this great service again. Well, hopefully we won't have to but you know how that goes.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Alyx Rich,"Incredible service, less than 2 hours to call back, diagnose, and send an Rx to the pharmacy. All this on a Sun.

The physician called me promptly on time, asked me all the relevant questions, was super pleasant and patient. Wonderful experience overall and I saved a lot of time trying to find an appointment at such a short notice, going to the hospital and waiting there. I understand there will be cases where seeing the doctor in person makes more sense but otherwise I will be coming back to PlushCare again.

Misha Macias,"Heaven sent! Â I have 2 herniated discs which, luckily, I've been able to manage without surgery for the last several years. Â I hurt my back very badly a few days ago - My back hasn't been in this condition since I first found out about my herniated discs 9 years ago. Â The pain is so severe that the only position that wasn't excruciating was to be on my back (even on my back, I have to constantly switch to laying on my sides after 10-15 mins in any one position). Â Given I couldn't even stand up, let alone walk, I wasn't sure how I was going to see a doctor.

Â I currently have no medical insurance so I was in a panic. Â I got online and found them on Yelp, excellent reviews. Â I made my appointment for 9:30, the earliest they had available, but reeeeeally wanted something earlier so I called before business hours. Â They called me back when they opened and I explained my urgency for getting an earlier appointment. Â They completely understood and booked me for 9am. Â Dr. Rudy called me right at 9, asked me questions and was extremely helpful. Â I told him my preferred pharmacy and he advised me that there was a pharmacy closer to my house where the prescription would be cheaper. Â I decided to stick with the pharmacy I chose because my husband (prescription fetcher) knew where it was, so Dr. Rudy emailed me a $10 off coupon for Target! Â The appointment was only $45 and he said the follow up appointment was free if I had any further questions or adverse reactions to the medication.

Lee Khan,"WOW! Â VERY impressed!! Â I was online looking for the closest Urgent Care to call and be sure they took our insurance (in-network), found one and my husband, VERY SICK, headed upstairs to get ready to head out the door. Â While he was doing that, I continued to scroll down the search engine and found ""Plush Care"" and decided to check them out. Â TO MY AMAZEMENT, it was something I felt, most suited to a man's need, as most men cannot STAND going to the doc's office and, a great place for anyone who's WAY TOO SICK to even get out the door, much less into their cars to drive in a legal, mental, HEALTHY state mind. Â I marched upstairs to read what Plush Care offered and what the cost would be and before I could even get a third of their website read to him, he immediately asked me to make him the appointment because, as I already knew, he did NOT want to go to an Urgent Care and have to sit for God knows how long, all the while not feeling well. Â I made his appointment and, TADA!!! Â They called!! Â I had to speak on his behalf because he has this nasty, dry cough that when he talks, the cough goes rampant. Â The doc asked a few questions, got to the bottom of the diagnosis, gave his recommendations, told me what he was going to do as far as calling in the meds and BAM!! Â ALL DONE!! Â I am VERY PLEASED w/the professionalism, empathy and care the doc gave to me for my husband ""OVER THE PHONE!!"" AND, they will also do VIDEO CHAT if that's what you prefer!! Â LOVE LOVE LOVE this alternative line of care! Â THANK YOU PLUSH CARE for the idea, the thought and the time you are all willing to do for the people who NEED YOU!! Â Oh, AND, I forgot to mention, when you use Plush Care, a portion of your cost goes towards other kids who NEED medical care but cannot afford it!! Â That's an added bonus!!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Jem Steele,"I had a fantastic experience with PlushCare. Â Booking an appointment for same day at a convenient time for me was simple online.

Â I had a question for the dr. the next day (a Saturday) and he got back to me immediately. Â They saved me time off from work (to drive to dr, wait around as my dr. always runs late, driving back) and I didn't need to be exposed to other sick folks.

I went to the website to schedule an appointment, was able to choose the doctor that was the best fit for me based on bio information and the best time for my schedule based on doctor availability and heard back from a doctor within 15 minutes or less. This was one of the simplest urgent care experiences I have ever had and I will definitely be using PlushCare again in the future.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Rikki Mcneill,"PlushCare is medical care as it should be....caring, timely, thorough, efficient, and respectful of your time! Â I am on vacation in Naples, Florida, and knew that I had the beginnings of a UTI. Â Tried to call my doctor at home to no avail...then started googling urgent care clinics in the area. Â PlushCare came up in the search and I am so happy that I decided to try this wonderfully convenient online service rather than wait in a germ filled urgent care center. Â I set up an appointment with Dr. Rudy who then called me right at our scheduled time for a video chat about my symptoms. Â He asked me a series of thorough questions and then went about choosing the correct medicine for my ailment. Â He couldn't have been kinder...in fact, I really believe that this video chat was a better experience than I have ever had with my primary doctor at home. Kudos to Dr. Rudy and all of the Plushcare staff for providing a much needed service.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Jun Blevins,"I am so happy that Plush care is finally here. During the holidays, I needed a doctor to fill a prescription for an anti-inflammatory. I knew exactly what I needed for a long term condition. When I finally was able to see a doctor after taking time off from work, he agreed with me. I wasted several hours. It would have been so much easier with an appointment at Plush Care. Now when I have a routine medical issue, I just make an appointment online from the comfort of my own office or home and I get great medical advice. I would recommend this medical health care to all.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Baran Mcguire,"Just like the other reviews stated, this is a great way to get urgent care. Â I needed to get a prescription for an antibiotic for a female issue. Â Made the appointment (which was easy to make online). Â The Dr. called right on time, went over my symptoms, did a medical history, and prescribed the antibiotic I had used before. Â This just saved me the inconvenience of waiting on an appt. with my Dr., and you can't beat the price.",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Lyndon Crosby,"Thank goodness for Plush Care. My 4 year-old daughter got a common eye infection while we were visiting my in-laws for the holiday. I found Plush care online and was able to easily book an appointment with a doctor for 30 minutes later.

Ceri Rubio,"A friend had recommended that I sign up for Plush Care. Last week, I woke up in the middle of the night and was heading to a local Urgent Care. I called ahead and they had said their wait was 2 hours. I then called Plush Care to make an appointment and got a representative that was awesome! The representative was very professional and answered all my questions quickly and professionally. Plush Care got me in to see a doctor right away and I was able to go pick up my prescription.

Etienne Correa,"New Years Day 2015 I have a terrible chest cold and needed to see a doctor, well of course not a doctor open within 35 miles unless I wanted to go to the hospital. So I decided to search the Internet for urgent care and found this website Plush Care. I was very curious and called the 800 number listed, an answering machine answered and I left my contact information. Â At this point I thought I was out of luck and had to wait until the following day and then my phone rang, well guess who it was a Plush Care representative. Â The nice person walked me through on what to do to get an appointment and within an hour I was on the phone talking with a real doctor. Â The doctor was great, he prescribed me some medication and within 15 minutes my prescription was ready at my pharmacy. Â This is so much better than going to my normal doctor, I never had to leave my home to get diagnosed. My husband did have to go pick up my prescription. I would highly recommend Plush Care to everyone. -G.G.G.Gilroy, CA",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"

Manraj Foreman,"Outstanding experience with Plushcare! I had a minor infection requiring a trip to the doctor. My primary care physician was booked up all week, and I was dreading the thought of waiting in line at the urgent care center, so I decided to try Plushcare. Holy moley, what a great experience! This is how going to the doctor should always be! I called in to have the Plushcare folks input my insurance information into my account (they mentioned that they're working on adding that capability to the website soon so you won't have to do it over the phone), and I was able to immediately get an appointment within the hour for a video call with Dr. Rudy. He joined the video call precisely on time and was extremely warm, friendly, and professional -- I felt immediately at ease. He asked me lots of detailed, relevant questions about my issue and my medical history, and then recommended a course of antibiotics to treat the infection. He was able to send the prescription over to my local pharmacy electronically while we were talking. The whole process was incredibly easy and efficient and pleasant (and cost me only my regular insurance copay, nothing more). It saved me a huge amount of time and stress by not having to go wait at a crowded urgent care center (which as we all know is really never an enjoyable experience). I highly recommend this service!",5,PlushCare Primary Health,"Doctors, Urgent Care, Concierge Medicine"
Indiana Pritchard,"Great online scheduling and fantastic availability. I was able to schedule an appointment for today even though I booked after 5 pm yesterday. I got a quick onsite X-ray to augment what was done at Zuckerberg General Hospital, and received a super helpful assessment and answers to all my questions. I was in and out in less than an hour.One helpful criticism is that the online onboarding form -- after you book your appointment -- is not super intuitive. I thought there was a bug in signing my releases. It was my own user error coupled with a poor error message. You have to sign the form AFTER acknowledging both releases. Other than that very minor thing, everything was exemplary. Even that UX issue is minor considering what other practice allows you to even fill out an onboarding form before you get to the office?Another thing people should be aware of. This is an extremely efficient office. So you aren't necessarily going to start right off seeing Dr. Dickinson. I saw Breiana Brady, PA-C and thought her care was well educated and reasoned from extensive experience. Had I needed more serious intervention, I'm sure Dr. Dickinson would have gotten involved. This is great for keeping costs low and service high. But it would be important to mention it if you were looking for a second opinion or another provider after seeing a different Orthopedist.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

Lilith Santos,"Very friendly, informative and efficient staff. I saw Dr. Dickinson for a severe upper/mid back pain. He was very thorough with the exam and ruled out nerve related injuries. With that knowledge, he didn't request any imaging, which saves me $$. He was also very patient and detailed-oriented when explaining and answering my questions. Some muscle relaxant was prescribed and I'll be doing a few sessions of physical therapy. It was a very pleasant experience overall. Their uninsured visit price is $225 but I was billed $129 with my insurance rate -- it might be a lower co-pay with a low deductible plan.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Amari Robertson,"I originally came to this business for a second opinion, but they've moved up as my primary due to the quality of care I've received from Dr. Dickinson and the ease of doing business with Urgently Ortho. Â Dr. Dickinson is great at both listening and explaining situations and option. Â It's also great to have the option of being there in person if necessary, but skipping that and doing telehealth when in person isn't necessary. Â So much less time wasted driving, parking, and waiting in waiting rooms. Â Depending on the situation, I've been using telehealth for about 5 years and I can't recall having a better experience.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Eman Sheldon,"Never been more thankful for Urgently Ortho than I am this weekend. I slipped and twisted my ankle yesterday afternoon. Had a telephone appointment with my PCP this morning who ordered an X-ray to rule out a break or fracture. It's not the best time to be going into a hospital for an X-ray with the coronavirus so I turned to Urgently Ortho. The Urgently Ortho staff fit me in for an in-person exam and some x-rays. No break, no fracture, but confirmed I tore some ligaments. Recommended I RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevate), and wear a boot--which they had on hand (so no waiting for an Amazon delivery or going to a pharmacy).I highly recommend the Urgently Ortho team!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

Â Multiple women helped me that day - the woman at the front desk noticed my phone was dying and proactively offered me a charger (thank you!). The first X-ray tech came in and was so funny and really helpful. And finally the Dr. who came in and looked at my foot explained the X-ray in details, walked me through what had happened to my metatarsal and what could happen in a best case/worst case scenario, and finally fitted me with a boot. This was my first time breaking a bone and I was there alone, but truly couldn't have asked for a better experience from the team there.

Â After driving 45 minutes to get there, they said they were not in-network for my plan and wanted to charge almost three times the amount I should have paid. Â I walked out extremely disappointed.Complete waste of time.Update: got a call from their office. Â They were very apologetic about the mixup. Â Appears that some of the staff need better training on the intricacies of insurance. They offered to treat as in-network.

Sheridan Melton,"Beware of the surly office manager here. She literally just offended my client who has obvious cognitive impairment. After his therapy where is actually being treated for the very treatment this person gave him, we made a scheduled visit. This person made a very harsh and insulting comment towards him, she was unwelcoming and frankly didn't need to intervene in the pleasant exchange we had with the receptionist. Her only interaction was to lift her head, reprehend my client for his damaged casting and mumble offensive comments to the receptionist. It was off putting to my client who in no way whatsoever was inappropriate. He was cordial and simply lacked the ability to articulate.Nobody should be treated this way because they may not look or present in way. She made him feel unwelcome and demeaned. As a professional, I was personally insulted by her treatment towards me. It was clear I was there for a reason and at this point well aware I was his caseworker. She chose not to treat me as a professional and chose to go on and lecture my client, and to insult him. Perhaps my brown skin color wasn't recognizable as a professional? Sadly Inappropriate.",2,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Cooper Barrera,Amazing place with super helpful staff and doctor. I called them when my mother broke her leg and they scheduled us immediately.

Hetty Baker,"Some damage cannot be undone. Â In retrospect, I really wish I hadn't gone to Urgently Ortho, and since I picked them based on reviews here I feel obligated to write this.My examination experience at the clinic was decent and I think they'd be fine for minor incidents. Â However, if your injury calls for an MRI, I do not recommend this clinic.Unfortunately, Urgently Ortho chose to partner with a disreputable imaging center (2-star average on Yelp at 160 reviews, with tons of horrifying stories) that they also delegate insurance matters to. As a result of their incredible incompetence, it took two weeks after I was seen to get insurance preapproval and finally get the MRI done. Â That required me having to personally make multiple follow-up calls to the imaging center, my insurance company, and Urgently Ortho to get the required info passed and things moving along.It turned out I tore my meniscus, which has a very short time window in which it can be effectively repaired through surgery. Â Naturally it takes time to also find a good surgeon and get surgery scheduled. Â This delay has had a devastating effect on my chances of healing, damage is that is irreparable and could have been easily avoided. Â (My insurance approved the request within 2 business days once they had the complete information requested).On top of that, the poor image quality resulted in a misdiagnosis of my torn ACL. Â This made me opt for a much more intrusive type of surgery than what was called for by my actual injury, and which has repercussions I will suffer for the rest of my life. I understand that these business relationships are commission based and are important for the bottom line, but if it were me I would put the patient's best interest first and pick a better business partner.",2,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Rhian Fox,I Â want to revise my review because I may have been unfairly critical. The group at urgently ortho was very apologetic and submitted my MRI request to Cigna 3 times and they finally agreed to cover it. So I would say they were very strong advocates on my behalf. Also never use Cigna health insurance since they make you run around in circles for weeks before you can actually get procedures approved!,4,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Aden Davie,I am so grateful Urgently Ortho exists. Â I got in an accident while in Mexico on vacation. Â I came back to San Francisco looking for an Orthopedic doctor to look at my situation ASAP. Â I made several calls and I was told appointments weren't available for several days or I didn't call backs at all. Â Urgent Ortho was so responsive and provided service the day I called. Â It turned out I had a dislocated shoulder. Â The staff at Urgently Ortho were so knowledgable and attentive and guided me through getting my shoulder put back in place. Â Definitely would recommend Urgently Ortho for Orthopedic services.,5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Shay Hope,I can't say enough nice things about Urgently Ortho. I saw both Dr. Dickinson and PA Brady for severe plantars pain. They worked with me over 3 months (!!!) to get me to a virtually pain free state. Appointments are super easy to make and usually available within a few days which is near impossible most ortho places in the city. They handled everything with insurance- all I had to do was bring the card. I never had to wait they were always on time or even early. I would absolutely go back for any ortho need I have in the future.,5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Kiri Wilkes,I needed to see an orthopedic specialist to get a note by Monday. I was excited to see this clinic was open on the weekends and accepts my insurance.

Didn't wait long (under 10 mins) before going into a room and seeing the physician assistant Breiana Brady. She was kind, funny, gentle (important) and pleasantly thorough with her questions.

Kaycee Parrish,"I have nothing but good things to say about Urgently Ortho. It was an unexpected experience and I am so glad for it. Urgently Ortho was everything you would WANT in an Urgent Care experience. I sprained my ankle a week ago and was worried that it may have been worse than a sprain. I did a quick search on Yelp for Orthopedic Urgent Care and within a few minutes I had an appointment.As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Liu, who was super accommodating and professional (and fly, might I add). The check-in process was all digital and super fast/easy. Liu showed me to my room, took my vitals and listened intently as I described my injury. Breiana saw me shortly after and I knew I was in good hands. Breiana was knowledgeable, charming and super personable. She even checked on me to remind me she didn't forget about me while I waited for my x-rays to be processed. She answered all my questions and was very patient with me. I asked Liu how new the office was and it only opened in November! Considering how new Urgently Ortho is, I can confidently tell you that the level of professionalism, efficiency, and care is just beyond. I left feeling very well taken care of. I recommend Urgently Ortho to anyone and everyone who is looking for the real deal in Urgent Care!Thank you, Liu and Breiana!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

Also, the late business hours saved me from making a trip to the emergency room where I would have most likely spent the night in pain.

Tracey Powers,"This place is brilliant. Â I hate going to the doctor, even more when it's because of an annoying injury (I mean, what injury is convenient though?) and because of all the surprise medical costs seemingly associated with urgent care / emergency visits. Â However, that was not the case here. Â After an accidental slip on some stairs last weekend and a week of stubbornly limping around, I finally caved and decided to find someone to x-ray my foot. Â  I called them and they were able to check my insurance to see my coverage and get me in right away. Â It was totally worth it (my other option was to tough it out and find a regular doctor during the workweek). Â If anyone you know has a suspected spain/broken bone, this would be my first stop. Â The price is so reasonable it's not worth 4+ hours in an ED or missing work in the middle of the day.

It's the kind of place where you just feel taken care of the second you walk through the door. The team communicated with me in depth every step of the way, which really eased my fears. I walked in afraid due to my pain, and they put me at ease right away. They did detailed testing of my body, strength and range of motion, listened to my symptoms and concerns and also performed imagining of my body from several different angles. The specialist walked through each and every image with me, explaining anatomically how I looked. I knew at that moment that I had chosen the right place. They care about what they are doing. They took their time with me to make sure all of my questions and concerns were answered. They recommended me a solid treatment program following my appointment. I would hands down recommend them to anyone of my colleagues, family and friends .",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Brooke Avery,"Urgently Ortho is incredible. Convenient appointments, top notch staff, high tech office.

Denny Rodriquez,"Called in to see if I could schedule a same day appointment on a weeknight and was surprised to find immediate availability. Injured my knee somehow playing soccer the night before after experiencing a week of stiffness in it and within minutes, Breiana was able to diagnose my injury through a comprehensive review. Got x-rays done the same day and getting an MRI ordered ASAP to follow suit with the appropriate action plan.Great location as it is pretty central in the city and has clean and modern office facilities. Would highly recommend anyone to stop by for whatever injury needs!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Carter Camacho,"I had an unfortunate experience of rolling my foot in my garage. I heard a ""pop"" and immediately thought I broke my ankle. I had planned to go to the emergency room at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital but they were very busy and asked me to make an appointment as they had other more serious injuries they were treating at the time. I came across Urgently Ortho through a Google search. They were close to my home. I called them and they said they could see me in a half an hour. It was Sunday and I had an Orthopedic Surgeon ready to examine my foot in half an hour. Off I went and glad to find out they are located on the ground level - easy access from the car as I was now on a 4 wheel scooter and not able to walk or go up any stairs. The office is clean, airy, bright, and the check-in process was a breeze. Everything is DIGITAL check-in on an iPad. You can even take your own selfie and upload your photo for your patient file.Dr. Dickinson greeted me immediately and did a thorough examination of my foot. He suspected it may be broken due to the location of the swelling and pain. After a few XRAY's it was confirmed that I had indeed broken my foot in two places. He immediately fitted me up with a boot and explained in great detail about ""next steps"" to recovery. I was super impressed with this office and felt VERY lucky to have found him. He gave me a prescription for the pain and while my friend was filling my prescription I got a call from the emergency room saying they ""they were ready to see me now"". I told them I had found a Sports Orthopedic Surgeon specialist and had already been seen.I will continue to see Dr. Dickinson because I believe he is the best. I Googled him and he has quite the experience as a Sports Orthopedic Surgeon. His demeanor is soft, kind and sweet. He will answer any questions you have and takes as much time as needed. If you have an injury such as foot, ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, wrist, hand or any other joint issues please make an appointment to see Dr. Dickinson. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this business.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Precious Wolf,"Who would have thought a visit to a doctor's office could be such a wonderful experience? As someone only in town for a few days, seeing a traditional orthopedist was not an option. I was pleasantly surprised to find Urgently Ortho. From my first phone call to set up an appointment, through to check out, it was smooth sailing. I asked ahead about the pricing. I found it to be quite affordable, especially considereding the fact that you are seeing a specialist. The office itself is beautiful, clean, and conveniently located. Upon arrival, I was seen immediately, being told the appointment would take about 40 minutes (which was accurate). The man who checked me in and took my vitals was very knowledgeable. He seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. I was impressed by my doctor Brianna, who was charming, relatable, and confident. An accupuncturist joined in on my appointment as well, offering valuable insights. Brianna gave me a prescription and a plan of action, and all three of them gave me enthusiastic personal recommendations for an upcoming trip to Asia!You can't beat this level of care and convenience. Thanks Urgently Ortho!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Arlo Irving,"When my mom hurt her knee over the weekend, we were about to go to the ER, but then found Urgently Ortho on a whim, and I'm SO glad we did. Â Rather than waiting for hours to be seen by a generalist, we were seen right away by Dr. Dickinson, who is a specialist in orthopedics, so was able to diagnose right away what was going on with my mom. Â Years ago my husband hurt his ankle, and the ER doc gave him the complete wrong advice, exacerbating his injury, so it was really comforting to be seen by someone who clearly knew what was going on. Â  Â  The hours are super convenient, customer service is top-notch, office is new, clean and check in was a breeze. Dr. Dickinson is a great Dr.--I'll be recommending Urgently Ortho in the future!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Nadia Forbes,"The staff here is incredible. Everything you want when you are in serious pain- kind, patient, gentle, and on the ball. I went in late Friday night w a torn meniscus and a knee that popped out. They took x-rays and did a full exam and explained the next steps without scaring me;) Each one who works there was clearly chosen for a reason. The Dr. gave clear instructions and I felt more taken care of immediately than at a regular hospital.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Sheldon Vargas,"My husband called me during an evening run where he ""forgot"" to wear a headlamp, having tumbled over himself due to a pavement crack. Â It turns out he broke a bone in his elbow, and I was able to be a hero by finding and depositing him at Urgently Ortho (someone still had to go pick up the kids). Â This is the perfect spot for a sports injury that is short of full-scale trauma where you're brought in by the ambulance on a stretcher. Â The office stays open from 9-9 on weekdays, the waits are as advertised over the phone, and the providers are excellent. Â My husband primarily saw PA Breiana, who also consulted with Dr Dickinson with the X-rays that evening. Â Breiana and her team cleaned everything up, provided a minimally invasive treatment plan without surgery, and provided further referrals to physical therapy. Â The X-ray machine is in-house and on-site, as well as materials for slinging and casting, so no run around. Â Follow-up visits have also been thoughtful with all questions answered. Â This is a great new business, and they can also handle non-emergency work. Â We plan to move our son to this practice, as his ""big name"" ortho person does not have the bandwidth and may have missed a diagnosis recently.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

I made an appointment online and then received a phone call from the receptionist confirming my appointment and following up with me. Great customer service! Once I got to my appointment the place looked so new and clean, a big plus. The specialist saw me right away and took her time with me asking questions and feeling my back.

Anand Reed,"As a repeated offender for knee injury, I am really glad to have found this place. Due to a knee injury (that popping sound) from playing tennis, I was not able to walk or bear weight with my right knee. While I was weighing the ER or other urgent care options, this came up in a yelp search and fits exactly what I need. For what I have, going to the ER would mean hours of wait and $$$$$. Other urgent care are more generic and I would rather see a specialist. I really like - their online system which was easy to use and has a nice GUI. Â - they are on street-level - you know how difficult it is to walk in crutches, not to mention climbing stairs.- the appt started and finished on time.Obviously not looking forward forward to another injury, but now I know where to go!",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Brody Vang,"I injured my finger &amp; after a month of it still hurting, decided I needed to see a doctor. Â I found urgently ortho in a google search, because I wanted to go somewhere other than a hospital where there would be both an x-ray and a doctor who could diagnose &amp; help fix an injury. Â They are open from morning to night &amp; I was able to grab an after work appointment the next day with super easy online booking. Â The check-in process was easy, and I was seen quickly. Â I got an x-ray done &amp; an orthopedist carefully explained what the issue was. Â She even talked to my Dad on speakerphone, who had a bunch of additional questions - so nice of her! Â They put me in a splint, set up a return date, and I was on my way.

Jaydan Manning,One of the best experiences I've had a doctors office. Easy to book an appointment in advance.The office was clean; the staff was professional and efficient.

Rang up the team at Urgently Ortho, they quoted me a price and let me know to come by a few hours later. Everyone was incredibly friendly, saw me right away and got xrays done. X-ray results came back in minutes. They walked me through them and answered all of my questions. Fortunately nothing was wrong and they didn't rush me out at all.I was in and out within 30ish minutes and the bill was significantly less than they initially thought. Couldn't recommend them more, and will definitely be back if I have any more tumbles.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Leslie Nieves,I was seen by a PA who was very nice but said i looked fine and lucked out after a bike accident. I went to a sports medicine doctor who told me I tore my ACL after 10 minutes of evaluation. A MRI confirmed that I had tore my ACL.

Kellan Welsh,"Every major city should have an Urgently Ortho! Â I got great medical service in a modern environment with friendly staff when I had sudden and unexplained shooting pain. Â My nurse's hotline recommended I go to the ER, but I felt that was overkill. Â At the same time, I didn't want to ignore the pain for too long and wait weeks for an Ortho appointment. Â Urgently Ortho was the perfect in-between option to deal with an urgent pain issue that didn't quite merit an ER visit. Â They spent time trying to diagnose my problem and I felt they got the diagnosis right. Â They then started a conservative plan of treatment and that's all I needed. Â There were more aggressive options, such as casting, and that definitely wasn't needed in my case so I'm glad they had the sense to start slow. Â You can feel confident that your issue will get professionally and competently addressed at Urgently Ortho.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Ayat Rankin,"My boyfriend and I had made a weekend trip up to San Fran this past weekend, and unfortunately coming down a flight of stairs I broke my ankle. We google searched Urgently Ortho and made an apt online which literally took a minute. Next day we headed over to Urgently Ortho and was immediately greeted by Lew who was so accommodating and helped us fill out our paperwork and explained to us our options especially because we were from out of town.

Claire Buchanan,"I had a bad fall yesterday and went to the CPMC Davies emergency room. I really didn't want to go as I knew what type of experience it would be and sure enough they lived up to their poor reputation. Beyond a bad experience, I also was misdiagnosed as having no fractures. Still in pain this morning, I came across Urgently Ortho. Making an appointment was easy. Initial patient setup was a breeze and I was seen right away. After reviewing my x-rays and taking the time to actually evaluate my injuries, they suggested one more x-ray. That simply involved going to another room where it was quickly performed and evaluated. Needless to say, that's where my fracture finally showed. I was in and out in under an hour (compared to four at CPMC) at a fraction of the price and with a level of care that can't even be compared. I will be having my follow up sessions here.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Henley Bass,"These people helped me during a day that was practically nightmarish. Hurt my knee and was scrambling to find someone who would examine it today since my previous employer's insurance expires this coming Monday. Not only did they schedule me the same day, but it was the best orthopedic experiences I've ever had (I've had several knee surgeries, so I've been to many). They listened to my entire situation before examining, and the first doctor brought in her colleague to give me an immediate second opinion. After examining me and giving me a diagnosis, they're trying to get me seen for an MRI before my insurance expires. That's an incredible amount of care for a 7:30pm appointment on a Friday. I don't know what I would have done if it weren't for these people--simply amazing during an incredibly stressful time.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Logan Cervantes,"Went here today for a painful foot sprain. Who knew orthopedic urgent care was a thing? It was super convenient to be able to see an experienced specialist and have access to x-ray machines on a weekend. And I also appreciate not being exposed to the typical viruses of a normal urgent care waiting room. (Our family has been sick enough this winter from everything going around preschool). The office is brand new (it has only been open for 2 months), the doctor was nice, listened patiently, and answered all of my questions.

Piper Glenn,The absolute worst. They were useless and offered little to no care. You likely wont see a Dr. You will probably see a PA who will simply recommend physical therapy without listening to your concerns or injuries.

Never come here!!!!,1,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

I've tried other doctors, but they didn't specialize in sports injuries and didn't know how to fix my problems or how to prevent them from coming back. The group at Urgently Ortho were the first who actually understood my injuries and what caused them. With their evening hours, visits were very convenient given my busy schedule.

The entire visit was pleasant and seamless and the space and equipment is brand new and very clean. I was so pleased with my experience that when my boyfriend suffered an injury later that same day we returned to Urgently Ortho and they squeezed us in just before close (8pm every day - another plus).

Morgan Cohen,"About a month ago, I fell down my stairs and thought I just sprained my ankle so I didn't go to the doctor. Fast forward to last weekend, it was hurting MORE than it had been and my friend convinced me to go get an xray - problem is it was Saturday, and my insurance is Kaiser, but I didn't want to wait for hours to get seen so I looked up Urgently Ortho's number. Â I had checked them out on Yelp when I first fell but decided to go on my vacation without seeing anyone about my ankle. I also have a health savings account and high deductible plan, so sometimes it's not much more for me to pay out of pocket, and I get seen quicker somewhere else. Â I called Urgently Ortho around 3pm, spoke to Liu who is the founder &amp; COO (and wearer of many hats because he also checked me in AND did my xray!), told him my story, he told me how much it would be and I said great, how soon can you see me? Â Their last appointment of the day on the weekends is 3:30 and it was open, so he took some basic info over the phone and I hobbled to my car to rush over there. Â I got parking right in front, finished signing in (via Ipad!), and then he took me right back for a quick consult with Dr. Dickenson, got xrays, the doc reviewed them, told me the good news (NOT BROKEN!!!) and even went over the xrays with me, suggested I start PT right away, gave me a copy of my xrays, and I was home by 4:15pm. Â Everything was quick and painless from first phone call to exit, both Liu and Dr. Dickenson were super nice and professional, the offices were modern, clean and convenient to my house (and to Kaiser if I had to go there after all!). Â Sure beats waiting at Kaiser all afternoon! Â If I ever need to see an orthopedic specialist again (I'm so hoping I won't but...) I would definitely consider coming to UO over Kaiser especially if it's on a weekend (UO is open 10am to 4pm!) or after hours during the week (open till 10pm M-F!) and I would recommend them to others as well.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"
Tyler Livingston,"I broke my foot in early November of 2019, and had gone to Dignity GoHealth's urgent care the next day per referral through my school, USF. Based on my status as a full-time student and on the lower socioeconomic side, the GoHealth clinician referred me to Urgently Ortho for follow-up exams and X-rays since their service is both eco friendly complemented with quality service. Both of my follow-up appointments fared superbly quick and easy, but not rushed, as well as plenty of engaged care from the front desk staff as well as the doctors. They always allowed time for any questions I might have and were upfront about cost and insurance providers' coverage. I thought my insurance, Student Aetna, wouldn't cover their service so I opted to pay out of pocket on the first visit. But they had insisted I tried to file the service through my insurance just in case-- and it turned out they did! So I actually got some money back from the first appointment. Really great service all-around :D",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

I tore my ACL and went in right away. I was extremely swollen, yet she was still able to deduct that my ACL was likely torn. They took an X-ray right then to ensure no bones were broken. Next, they had me get an MRI from RadNet. I saw in another review that the MRI place was terrible before and was amazed that they had switched partners so fast based on patient feedback! RadNet was fantastic. They were very proactive and got me scheduled within 2 days. They called me again to let me know there was a cancellation so I got in even earlier, and on a Sunday! Super nice staff, quick, and efficient. After the MRI, the Urgently Ortho team scheduled me right away to read the results. Dr. Dickinson was fantastic.

I made an appointment for later that night. When I arrived everything was super clean and nice. The receptionist was warm and helpful. I was offered water 3 separate times. The X-ray technician was super nice and concerned about my comfort. Both doctors on staff sat down with me and talked me through what they thought was going on with my hip. Their bedside manner was great. They listened and were very helpful. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who needs an ortho in a emergency situation or any situation.

Brandy Lacey,"I am visiting San Francisco from the east coast and had a reoccurrence of a meniscus injury in my knee. I was able to schedule my appointment at Urgently Ortho a day after a major holiday easily and the online check-in/patient portal made it a quick and convenient process to integrate into their system. I was also impressed by the high tech medical equipment they used to gather my vitals and that they use for X-Rays, etc. The administrative staff and Doctor who worked with me went above and beyond in answering my questions and attending to my needs. I was in and out of the office without a long wait and was reassured that their billing team would assist me if my out-of-state insurance presented any obstacles in coverage. I'd definitely recommend this service to others who need urgent care with an orthopedic speciality. It was very helpful to have an urgent care appointment with a provider who could accurately assess my knee injury and had extensive experience with this particular type of injury, as opposed to the type general practice urgent care physician who I'd seen when I first had the injury and put me in a leg immobilizer inappropriately because of lack of deep-field knowledge. Overall, I give this service a five star rating.",5,Urgently Ortho,"Urgent Care, Orthopedists, Sports Medicine"

Jerry Edge,"This review is for the Child birth center. ALL the personnel at the child birth center LOVE their jobs, and this is evident from the care they provide. My wife went into Labor at around midnight and we got to the hospital around 1 am. We were checked in right away by the nurses. Sarah Bartulis and Corey helped deliver our baby. Their bedside mannerism and care giving during labor and delivery were truly EXCEPTIONAL! I would give them 11 out of 5 stars if I could. While coming out our son ended up swallowing some meconium. The team swooped into action clearing the airways and helping our newborn breath. He ended up in the N-ICU overnight. Dr Ahmad and Dr brunei put us at ease by patiently answering all our questions. The nurses in the NICU were AMAZING. Being 1st time parents they gave us a lot of info about baby care taking and putting us at ease. Imalda Â and Claudia took care of our baby around the clock. All in all a truly great experience. The staff in the childbirth center took good care of my wife and son and made our stay as stress free as it could get. Â We are glad we choose this birthing center which has a truly exceptional staff. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a birthing center.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Lexi Duarte,"Not a good experience in the emergency room. Came in with an eye injury, after an hour of paperwork, doctor saw me for 5 minutes, told me they don't have an opthomology department in the emergency room and that she would have to call UCI to see what to do...Several, and I mean several hours later I was transferred to uci where I went through the same routine only to be told to go home and ""sleep it off"". Totally felt like no one cared and that I was trapped in logistical nightmare. In the end ended up seeing an opthomologist the next day for treatment and was charged several thousand dollars for the ER visit. What a joke this place, might as wel just go to UCI next time.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Jae Mclean,"Yes indeed it is a beautiful facility but I wish the staff would have focused more on customer services.I will not go into all the details following my knee replacement surgery however I felt that the hospital was in a BIG hurry to get get rid of . United Health Care told me I could stay an unlimited amount of time. My hospital stay was one night. Â This proved to be a major problem because I ended up in the ER. Â South Coast Global ER in Santa Ana treated me with the dignity and respect I wish I had received at Memorial Care.At 6:00 on my second day I asked when dinner would be arriving. Â Their response was at any minute . Â Again I asked at 6:30, 7:00, 7:30,8:00, 8:30. Â I got the same response. Â Finally Â at about 9:00 I phoned my husband to come and get me.That is certainly one way to get rid of a patient.They have apologized but It certainly does not make up for my frustrationand lack of care.

Rayan Mathis,"I had a miserable Emergency experience at this hospital. Like most people, I am not one to run to the emergency room for fun. Especially during these difficult times (Covid). After a long, painful night, due to a significant infected wound/rash on my back and leg, I decided to admit myself to the ER @ 10 am. I was scheduled and seen by Dr.Douglas E. Dennis. Immediately the Doctor looks at my sores and my condition and states, ""These wounds are not infected; there is nothing wrong with you at all. These wounds look perfectly fine."" I had to beg and argue with the Doctor that they are infected, and based on basic medical research, I should be on an IV with medicine (for Bacterial infection). At the end of the conversation, Dr. Dennis did nothing but made me suffer from my pain for 1 hour with no pain killers. At the same time, a Meth addict in the ER room was getting the red carpet treatment. Screaming and Cursing for hours. Throwing items around with not one single security guard present or being called to remove her from the facility. All of the medical staff members maintained this meth addict in the ER room while pushing me to go home and telling me that there is nothing they can do for me. Soon after being ignored and dismissed, the Doctor came back, discharged me, and sent me home. I had to bother my dermatologist on a Saturday night for a virtual appointment. Right away, the Doctor states these wounds are infected. These wounds are obviously infected. What did they give you? Were you given any antibiotics or ointment for the infection?? Â NOPE!!!I can't believe that the Doctor disregarded this infection and did nothing about it; it's unbelievable that he is an ER doctor and knows that an infected wound can lead to a severe illness.If you need emergency medical attention and are being taken to this hospital, PLEASE PLEASE stay away from Dr. Dennis. Ask for another Doctor of staff. You will not regret it. But If you are high and a meth addict and overdosing on drugs, this hospital will take care of you. BUT IF YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY, THIS HOSPITAL WILL DO NOTHING AND SEND YOU HOME WITH NOTHING OTHER THAN ADVIL. Memorial Care, please do something about Dr.Douglas E Dennis. for your patient's sake. Unless you don't care, who lives and dies.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Kaylan Dougherty,"This review is more so for billing than it is of the actual service. Because service was average or slightly above average, my review is 2/5 rather than 1/5. I've been to the emergency room in MemorialCare twice now: once in October and once in March. The first time in October, I was informed that I had two health insurances on my social security: Medi-Cal (which is invalid and should no longer be used) and Anthem Blue Cross. This was the first time I was aware in 2 years I was still on Medi-Cal so I was shocked to find it was still on my social. Even more shocked that they pulled my social rather than use my insurance card that I provided them. My health plan states that I cannot be on Medi-Cal while having an HSA. I Â specifically told MemorialCare not once, but MULTIPLE times that Medi-Cal is the incorrect insurance and should not be billed when they asked me to authorize the charge against my health insurance. Paraphrasing, I was told it didn't matter what I said because they will bill Anthem and then Medi-Cal if Anthem did not cover everything. When they stated this, I told them NOT to bill Medi-Cal and explained to them why over and over. They said they'll do the best they can which translate to: we will bill whoever we want because we want to make money as a hospital. Surprise surprise, I find out that my bill was billed to both insurances and now I have a headache and a mess to untangle. When I called MemorialCare billing to sort this out, I was basically told they would do the best they can, which meant I was still screwed and had to clean this mess up myself. In March when I ended up in the emergency room again (my fault for thinking everything was settled), I specifically told them not to run my Social and to run my Anthem insurance as it should have been, explaining once again, I was no longer eligible for Medi-Cal and Medi-Cal made a mistake for keeping me on their plan (had to call Medi-Cal to do a clean up as well). They couldn't guarantee me that Medi-Cal wouldn't be billed and I would have to follow up with billing. This is absolutely ridiculous",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Dustin Ware,"Just in regards to how they're handling covid protocols - went in June 2021 as soon as you're in the doors waiting for ER they're not making anyone wear masks (people accompanying patients too) their own NURSES were not wearing masks some had it on their chin others didn't have it all and would come to my room like that. Very disappointed. Dr. Kiarash Noorizadeh was also the rudest dr I've encountered. She wouldn't let me talk after asking me a question and said she thought i should leave since i was refusing treatment (I was unconscious when they brought me in so i was unable to swallow a pill they gave me it just came back out when they shoved it in my mouth, that was her example of me refusing treatment)",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Lenny Mejia,"This is about the Breast Center at Orange Coast. Been going to them yearly for mammograms, for about 15 years. Moved to the desert and the first year I went local. Didn't like the facility or the brusque way I was treated.Returned this year to Orange Coast and the difference is remarkable. First of all it's a quiet, nicely decorated space for a waiting room. Everyone is treated with care and respect. At this moment during COVID, they are very careful to limit the number of people in the waiting area as well as in the rooms in which you change into a gown and lock up your belongings.Their technicians are not clinical in the way they treat patients. They are unflaggingly pleasant and take their time as they go through the testing. A few days after I got scanned I received a call that there was something they saw on the mammogram and needed to take a second look, plus reserve the right to perform an ultrasound.  Immediately getting nervous on the phone the person could hear it and offered to get in touch with my primary care doctor for me to get the permission to do the testing. They scheduled me quickly and were very caring when I got there.To my surprise and relief, although I needed the ultrasound, someone looked at it on the spot and I got the good news as soon as the radiologist had seen it. It pays to schlep from Palm Springs for this and I've learned my lesson.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Deon Fuentes,"This a review specifically for Labor and Delivery!My husband and I want to give the biggest shout out to all of the nurses and Doctors and everyone else who works in this department. We had our daughter there on 9/12/2020 and it was the best experience we could have asked for. It started out with normal labor, but ended up being and emergent C-section. We had the most caring and nurturing staff help us from the check in all the way to our discharge. They made us feel as though our daughter was the most important baby in the hospital the entire time. We know they see dozens of babies each day, but our care was that good, that we felt like we were the only ones being looked after! We have to say that Nurse Leah is simply the absolute Â best! She made our terrifying situation bearable and made it extremely clear that she cared about our small family! She checked in on us several times after we had moved to postpartum which wasn't even her department!! You can't ask for that level of care! I cannot remember every single person that helped us, but those names I do remember are nurses Gigi, Sheila and Joanne, and our anesthesiologist (cannot remember her name either). We can't say thank you enough or show our gratitude for how well you all handled our delivery! There were several other nurses who were amazing and I wish I could remember their names, but please know we appreciate you just as much!! If you are looking for an OB, Dr Elizabeth Tracy should be your pick! She was so calm and professional throughout the entire pregnancy and through the delivery! We couldn't have done it without her! Needless to say, we were extremely impressed by this team (the A-team) and would absolutely, without a doubt, have our second child here again...of course with the same staff!

I do hope that she takes my feedback into consideration about communicating the visitation policy upfront for everyone visiting the hospital but she was nice in offering additional care to my grandma (although she already checked out). Antoinette did also mention that there were translators available if we were not allowed to be with her, but I'm not sure if there was someone with her, who spoke our language, that could have eased her.Nevertheless, I appreciate Memorial Care following back up with me with their prompt response.

I can't say enough about how great the nurses and doctors were. They were compassion, patience and gave service I think more than they had to. They were friendly and I called the nurse, Annie, twice during the night and she was very helpful, friendly, and a sense of humor. Her assistant, Susan, helped prep Larry to come home. The surgeon's Dr Khan and Dr Ryan are the best. I saw Dr Ryan after the surgery in the hospital and he is so nice and friendly and never acts like he is in a hurry. The hospital doctor, Dr Nanissir, was also caring and took his time with us. I don't know everyone's name, however; they were all great. The room was perfect also. The one drawback was the relief doctor for Dr Khan. Dr Zachery was not very friendly and we had a disagreement on when Larry was to come home. He finally agreed to one more day. Larry couldn't even get out of bed by himself and still can't. This doctor didn't seem to care and had no compassion at all. I don't think he wanted to be there.

Jocelyn Brady,"I wished I read the reviews of the ER here before driving my 4 year old daughter here to care for her open wound to the forehead. It is something I regret each time I look at her forehead now four months later with a scar larger than the wound she came in to have closed. We were never given the option to do stitch or dermabond. PA told us the hospital now use dermabond instead of stitches. He proceeds in a very rushed manner to work on my daughters cut. This all happened in the hallway. After he was done my husband asked why he didn't hold the skin together longer to allow glue to dry. He said ""this glue dries very quickly."" Â (He held to her wound no longer than 5-10 seconds) He applied only one layer. After seeing the way he did it and how little time he held to the wound we had this terrible sinking feeling that the wound did not closed. We asked about expectations of scarring. He said, ""hopefully no scar; if there is scarring it would be a thin line.""We followed the after care to the T. We kept the area dry and about a month later on thanksgiving the tape finally fell off and I was in tears to see how unsightly and big the scar actually is. Then I started to do research on surgical skin glue (dermabond). Everything became clear to me that the PA did not know what he was doing. Had he applied the glue correctly then the scarring would be insignificant like he had described but he failed to do what he was supposed to do. According to childrensmd.org , ""Wounds in areas of high skin tension such as the arm, leg or forehead will require stitches instead of dermabond."" Â (My child had a cut to the forehead but was never given the option of having stitches done at all). According to my research doctors must ""Hold the edges together for at least 30 seconds before releasing, with at least three layers applied to ensure optimal strength to the wound closure."" Â The PA applied one single later and held it for under 10 seconds and he was on his way. To know that my little girl could have avoided this big scar to her face had the PA offered her stitches instead of glue or had he held her skin for a necessary amount of time to allow that glue to dry just breaks my heart. Â He was heartlessly reckless. He was there to close a wound to a little girl's face but he behaved as tho he had to finish closing down a restaurant for the day; quick and without thought. I've addressed this to the hospital management but they were quickly dismissive claiming ""care was deemed appropriate""I have gathered the medical records and evidences and will be filing a grievance against the hospital to the state.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Mason Deleon,"I went to the emergency on July 6th because I had gallstones and I just had another gallbladder attack. I was admitted to the hospital and had surgery that same day and was kept over night. I just started getting billed SEPARATELY for everything. Emergency room is 1 bill, the hospital another bill. The ultrasound another bill...the list goes on. When I contacted the Billing department not only was I told that they couldn't merge all the bills into one bill. (Fountain Valley and St Joseph hospital have all merged all the bills into one for my family nembers in the past. They've had the same surgery i did) but they told me POINT BLANK ""we give you 11 months to pay your bill"" over $3,000 for the hospital ALONE. Not including the other bills that are an additional $2,000. But they also told me I had to pay over $300 a month. Yes, because that sounds so reasonable during a pandemic when people have been furloughed like me and have other bills to pay. Like my rent. No sympathy whatsoever from them. They sent me a form to fill out and I emailed them a long email where I included my bills and rent I pay monthly. They never responded to that email. They have the worse customer service I have ever encountered in a hospital. If you're in the Orange County area, do not go to this hospital. Go to Fountain Valley hospital instead they will accommodate your bill so that you're able to pay what you can even if takes longer. Oh. Also, when i was discharged from the hospital, they were refusing to provide a wheelchair for me. When I insisted on one, the nurse who wheeled me ouvt, kept complaining to the security guard and left me sitting in the sun. The security guard felt bad for me and he moved me to a shade nearby while I waited for my ride home.

Harleigh Murphy,"Always pay with a card! Their standard of procedure is you check in, they check your insurance, if you have a copayment, they collect it, ask you to sit and wait to get called back. Without fail, this is how they operate. My copayment is $10. On a few occasion, I had cash on me and thought, ""Oh I'll just pay cash. I've got $10 right here."" I either didn't ask for a receipt or take one. About 3 months later, I get a bill for $10 copayment for the visit. It was my fault for not taking a receipt because I can't prove that I paid it. It wasn't until I got a few more bills for the visits where I paid my copayment in cash that it dawned on me what they're doing. Someone is pocketing the money and double billing. Shame on you MemorialCare. Learned my lesson to always pay with a card for the digital trail and proof. Don't let them rob you like they did me. Might be a small amount but it's the principle and dishonesty of their actions.",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Esme Joyner,"Came to the ED yesterday and subsequently ended up being admitted to the Medical floor. Cannot say Â enough GOOD things about this whole facility and my experience here. Â First, in the ED, they are SO ""Covid prepared"". There are separate entrances for those with and without symptoms and the staff knows how to triage people appropriately. They had all of the right PPE, were very efficient and made me feel like my safety AND my illness were equally important to them. Â All of the staff was very kind and professional to me (especially Kay, Katherine, Zenia, Holly, Sandy, Tamara and PA Megan). I was quickly diagnosed and started my treatment right away. Â I cannot thank them all enough for their hard work and caring attitude!Seems this excellent care carries on throughout the facility because I am on the medical unit and I am BEYOND pleased with the care here too! Â They are extremely busy but I feel as though I am the only one here. The entire TEAM, from the environmental services people, dietary, medical and nursing staff and allied health team members have not let me down!! All are truly kind, compassionate and sure know how to care for and CARE ABOUT those being treated here. Â Catherine, Valery, Princess, Seini, Sharmi, Nicole, Nora, Adriana and Candice (Case Manager) have all worked so hard to care for my physical, mental and emotional health. Â My room is immaculately cleaned so I don't feel anxious about the spread of any infections. The delicious food is helping me rebuild my strength. Dr. Goldstein, Dr. Fatima Â and Dr.Noorizadeh all speak to me in terms I can understand, they are thorough and they include me in my plan of care which makes me feel like I have some control, especially during this crazy time in the world!I cannot thank all of this, and any additional staff, Â enough for getting me through this difficult and scary time. Â If you require medical attention it is here at OCMMC where you will find the best care in Orange County)!!",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

She is the type of person that will thoroughly explain your situation and discuss your options rather than jumping into something more invasive right away; that is something I appreciate in a medical professional.

Jess Forrest,"I called into the ER department to figure out how to approach getting in for testing since I called the COVID assessment line for Orange County and was told by the nurse on the line that I should be seen immediately. Â I have two children whom I didn't want to bring or expose to the ER, the person who answered (Carrie, I think, she spoke quickly) answered and rudely tells me I need to be in the ER to be seen. Â I ask her if there is a protocol since all this COVID stuff is going on- again rudely tells me I need to be in the ER to be seen. Â I mention the nurse's line recommending I get seen in the ER today and she just snaps and says ""look, we don't have a nurse's line so whoever told you that is not important to me. Â If you want to get seen, come in otherwise this is a waste of time' and just hangs up on me!What in the world?! Â I'm just trying to figure out how to approach the damn department so I can be seen without exposing my kids anymore than I need too since childcare is not available these days!I called Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center and my gosh! Â What a difference! Â They told me there's a tent outside I can check into and that security on site would help me navigate safely to the emergency room. Â THATS ALL I WAS ASKING- how to approach the ER in the safest way possible with my children. Â OC Memorial might be newer and shinier but this one sour experience trying to ask advice on how to get into the ER the safest possible was all I was asking- no medical advice just how to get in. Â I didn't want to just pop up with two kids since all this is going on and I was going off a nurse's line advice to call beforehand.

The nurses were all truly amazing at making me feel comfortable and reassuring me I was ok. Dr. Realmuto was so kind and compassionate.

Cody Tait,"I hate to leave a negative review for any nurses as I have friends in the nursing field and understand what a tough and demanding job it can be.However, the service my mom received when she visited the Emergency Room ""Hall"" after coming down with food poisoning was appalling and unacceptable. I didn't arrive until after the nurse had already inserted the IV needle in her arm but had noticed droplets of blood on the sheets. My mom was so weak and fatigued from throwing up but she managed to tell me to call the nurse because her arm was hurting so bad. When I tracked down the nurse, she came over and lifted my mom's arm and discovered that the needle was not properly inserted. I asked her if she could try again on the other arm and to please be careful to which the nurse scoffed in reply, ""We are always careful"". I was really upset but held my tongue as I did not want to cause a situation where the quality of my mom's medical care would be further compromised under the ""care"" of this nurse. I stayed with my mom to change her bed pans and had to request additional pans from other nurses. The assigned nurse was busy at her computer station inputting information for the majority of the hour or so that my mom was in the Emergency Hall. Each time I would have to ""bother"" her to request something for my mom. This nurse could have obviously cared less. I feel EXTREMELY SAD to think that anyone's sick parent would have to go to the ER alone and be stuck with a nurse like her. I was so thankful that I was able to be there to help my mom get the care that she so badly needed. I wish the assigned nurse had owned up to her mistake and redeem herself by taking extra care of my mom after that failed IV injection, but that was not the case. She was inattentive and rude. My mom had to stay overnight. I was too disheartened by the quality of service at the Emergency Hall so I stayed overnight with her.Thank you to Katrina the Emergency Technician who brought my mom an extra warm blanket and transferred my mom by stretcher to her overnight room when she was too weak to get up.Wishing everyone good health.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

My grandmother walked in with just a UTI and I have recordings of her telling me they were going to put her in a room next to a covid patient! the nurse in the back ground in a rude manner asked her why don't you want to go!! she repeated to tell me she had no symptoms and was there due to UTI she frequently would get! I can tell you so much about the nurses and Dr's involved but I trust that God will expose them one day! My grandmother was fine!!! She tried telling me something but they started giving her Morphine, she was unable to speak to me. Next day she passed! 2 weeks in there and now she is gone! but has life in heaven.

If there are other people who they ""feel"" are more sick than you, they will go first, despite how many HOURS you've been waiting. Oh and if MORE people keep coming in who ""appear"" more sick, they TOO will go before you, so if they keep on coming, too bad! It doesn't matter HOW LONG you've been sitting there. They also NEVER have any beds available so they will bring you back and forth from the lobby to the ""back"" AT LEAST 3 times.There is a HUGE lack of communication between everyone in that department, from the two VERY rude and clueless individuals at check-in to the RNs who find the time to casually stroll and be on their phones with a FULL LOBBY of patients and everyone else in between.They could care less about HIPAA violations here because no matter how you try to keep your voice down when speaking with them in the lobby, they somehow ALWAYS feel the need to YELL OUT your name address birthdate last 4 SS# so EVERYONE can know ya business too.I had my family switch to MEMORIALCARE MEDICAL GROUP because I was happy with 2 specific physicians, my PCP and a specialist.After this, I'm so ready to switch because this hospital could care less if my family member lived or died.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Lee Shannon,"My husband was sent to the Memorial Care Nuclear Medicine office for some Â pre-op testing. Â My husband is 88 years old and in quite good health for his age, so he has had little experience with this type of testing. Â He was apprehensive and nervous. Â We were met by Alfred M., who immediately put both my husband and myself at ease. Â He fully explained what tests were going to be done, how they were going to be done and how long they would take. Â He inserted an IV, asked my husband to put on a gown, administered the first dose and led my husband to a seat to wait for the medicine to take effect. Â Noticing that my husband was cold, he quickly brought him a blanket! Â Soon after that, Viet approached, bringing me a chair and a pillow for my husband's back. Â He began speaking to my husband in a soothing tone, telling him to be comfortable and relax. Â He teased my husband a little bit, telling him that if he thought everything would be OK, it would be. Â Both Alfred and Viet checked on us regularly until it was time for the first test. Â Alfred allowed me to be with my husband for the test, which involved a scary-looking machine that turned out to be no more than something to take photos of his heart. Â He told him how long it would take, that the machine would come close but not touch him, covered him with another blanket and did the test. Â Then he said that I couldn't be present for the next test, which was a chemical stress test, but that as soon as it was over, he would come and get me. Â He came back after the test was done, brought me back to the same room and there were sandwiches and apple juice for us! Â He knew my husband hadn't been allowed to eat anything the night before, so here was a snack! Â After we ate, Viet returned to remove my husband's IV. Â Then he prepared him for the last test, wrapping him tenderly in more blankets and reassuring him. Â As the final test was being done, Viet spent time with me, showing me breathing techniques to help warm the body and relax the spine. Â He is a real philosopher and a very kind gentleman! Â When the test was finished, he helped my husband up and stayed with us while he dressed. Â He escorted us to the door, always giving positive reinforcement. Â I can't say enough about the kindness and goodness these men showed us. Â Everyone in Nuclear Medicine was kind and understanding, but these two gentlemen went out of their way to make a scary experience a good memory. Â They are a credit to their profession.

Â About 3 months ago I was referred to that unit for physical therapy due to a foot drop condition that I was experiencing after chemo treatment. Â The root cause of numbness and tingling in my foot was nerve damage in my right leg to the point where I could not walk normally and could not even think of driving my car. Â When I began therapy there, I was fortunate to engage with Mitchell as my therapist. Â Mitchell is the absolute best! Â He is compassionate and supportive and really enjoys making a difference in the lives of his patients. Â Mitchell worked me hard in the 45 minutes sessions we had and assigned home exercises to do daily. Â The bottom line is that about half way through my 15 sessions, we began to see real results in terms of my ability to walk normally as the strength in my lower leg and foot increased. Â By the end of my treatment, I was not only walking but actually driving my car again. Â Mitchell was as excited as I was at the progress I was making.

Rickie Pritchard,"I am writing this review in hopes that those who excel in their field are awarded the proper attention, recognition and a thank you from a couple that has lived through several decades of medical treatment. Â This reaches out to the hospital, surgeon, nurse, lab technician and the valet attendant.Over the years there has been significant advancements in noninvasive treatment and it is apparent that MemorialCare has kept up with these changes. Â Places like Hoag in Newport are nice but paying for parking and the distance to get there has left me with the option to select this facility. Â Fountain Valley Regional Hospital is closer but ever since TENET healthcare corporation took over, cutbacks are wreaking havoc to the facility and the morale of the staff Â are in a downward spiral. Â Sure the waiting times have gotten longer due to the medical population doubling in size since the Obama administration, but that is no way to assess the service being rendered by a physician or by their team. Â  After 3 hospitals and 6 visits to the ER facility in the last 9 months, I believe MemorialCare has come on top. In particular, I want to recognize and thank Dr. Yee from the ER department and Gary, the RN from the imaging lab (sorry Gary, didn't catch your last name). Â Dr. Yee is calm, cool and collective under intense situations especially when unruly family members are literally screaming for attention of their loved ones. Â Dr. Yee's ability to perform successfully probably lies in his ability to assess and prioritize treatment quickly. Â As for Gary, your understanding, patience and kindness was very heartwarming. My wife Grete and I thank you very much for going out of your way to help us in time of need. As for the other team members of this facility, overall performance was definitely 4 stars.

Sumaiyah Macias,"This review is specifically for the Physical Therapy office at 18111 Brookhurst, Suite 2400. Last Thursday, my wife went to see a doctor at MemorialCare for neck pain. After receiving a referral from the doctor, we contacted physical therapy. We were happy that they had a same day appointment since we were already there, but then were informed we could not be told how much it would cost, their insurance person wasn't there. So instead, hey gave an appointment for the following day. After arriving and asking, how much the treatments would cost, we were told, our insurance person wasn't there. So my wife asked, could someone call us and tell us how much the sessions would cost. During the 15 consultation, the therapist recommended six sessions. When checking out and trying to schedule those appointments, we were informed that they had no appointments available for over 10 days. A week later, when we received the call from John the manager of the facility, we were informed the 1 hour consultation (which again, took about 15 minutes) would be $315, $300 of which we would have to pay, because of our deductible. When I protested and recommended we only be charged maybe a half hour, although sympathetic, he said no, they had things they had to do for the appointment, such as figuring our the insurance (?). When I asked about cost of future appointments, they were also $315, which (with insurance) we would have to pay $60 In closing, how is it that to see a physical therapist even with insurance can cost three times more than what it cost to see the doctor that recommended the therapy?",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Ruari Waters,"This review is for the OBGYN department and the birthing department (labor &amp; delivery &amp; postpartum care).I had been going to Dr Tran, Denise Castellanos, Corry Ann Varner, and Dr Ruiz. At each appointment prior to my labor they each made me feel at ease about my pregnancy and listened and answered all of my questions. I would recommend any of them. I would like to give a special shout out to my favorite nurse, Kim (I believe she is the main nurse for Dr Tran). She is one of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met. My due date was January 14. I was admitted into Labor and Delivery to be induced on January 21. Long story short, I had to have an emergency C-section. I was exhausted and terrified. The L&amp;D nurses, Summer and Ginger helped me so much. Dr Tran and a huge team performed the C-section (January 22, 2019). She did a beautiful job, everyone says it's the best they've ever seen. I was wheeled into the Postpartum unit where the team of nurses helped us for our 5-day stay. To be honest, my memory is a little hazy. I was a nervous, anxious, exhausted emotional wreck. There are so many people to thank: Heather, Minette, Michelle, Toni, Alli, and a bunch I cannot remember (I'm truly very sorry. I remember everyone's faces and what they did for us, but I don't remember names as well). Everyone tried to help calm my fears. As a first time mom I was unsure of myself to do anything correctly. Everyone made me feel like I was doing a good job. No one made me feel incompetent or unprepared. Everyone listened to me and cared for me during our stay. Everyone was really kind and thoughtful. I also want to thank the hospital staff in general. You hear about how awful hospital food was, I actually loved mine, so thank you to those that made the food and brought it to us. Thank you to the cleaning staff. Thank you so much to the lactation consultants who made it so much easier to breastfeed after they showed me different positions to try. I loved this hospital. I'm recovering, mostly recovered 100% physically and mentally. My baby is healthy and wonderful. If I have another baby I will be delivering at this hospital again. Best care you could receive.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Mason Howell,"I come here for serious stays about 4-5 times a year for the past 3 years. The emergency room does great with being efficient!! It's a small lobby but they also have additional seating outside under a tent or in a different room. The nurses on the oncology unit are a hit or miss, the aides are very sweet though. Three stars because not every stay has been filled with awesome staff. We come here because one of the best oncology doctors are contracted with them. Don't get confused by the elevators, especially at night and this goes for all hospitals, it's mega creepy if you don't remember where to go. Security here is very nice, easy going and helpful. I've only had one experience with the valet where the guy was genuinely lazy and didn't want to help us. It was valet next to the emergency room too! Prick. To enter the hospital, you have to go to the maternity unit - it's been like this for as long as I've been coming here. The doors won't open automatically for a certain time, so you have to stand in the cold until security notices you. Parking gets REALLY bad during the weekday, if you have an 11am-1pm appointment here, you may end up fighting people for parking spots. They have a small cafe in the Pavilion building but it's only open until the afternoon. A lot of restaurants can be found all around the hospital if you have to stay here overnight and it's right next to the 405.",3,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Naveed Gomez,"I gave birth to my baby girl here just a week ago. When I came to register during my pregnancy, I made sure that the center was aware that I had a service animal, and that my plan was to give birth vaginally. Because of this I had few problems coming in with my dog and support group (max of 3) when it was time.I came in during the night shift and worked with a wonderful RN named Lori. My dilation was just right for an epidural and the doctor was quick and efficient. I slept through the rest of my labor and delivered my baby with my service dog present in the morning. My dog gave her a good feet licking once we were done with sweet skin-to-skin contact and the vitamin K/eye drops.Our two night stay was lovely, though meals were mainly just for the mother with one extra meal for guest per day. Nurses were on point, though we did have a snag with one nurse that had a terrible experience with a pit bull (the same breed as my service animal). She'd ask us to crate my dog before she came in, even while she was performing a task on my legs (deep pressure therapy).The center was sure to send a doctor over, as well, to brief me on risks of PPD (post-partum depression) since I was considered high-risk. I really appreciated the care and offer of resources based on my insurance and medical history. Huge shout out to their lactation consultant, as well. Coincidentally she was also named Lori! She helped start my baby on breastfeeding and pumping. She's quite magical!",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Dr Mehta performed my 2 births which turned into c sections and I ended up hemorrhaging blood with my 2nd about an hour later. Dr Mehta rushed back and I had a complete blood transfusion and hysterectomy and if it wasn't for Dr Mehta, I would not be here! She literally saved my life!

Cordelia Bishop,"While all doctors and experiences are different, I understand it is important to occasionally have positive reviews of negative situations. This is no truer than when reviewing a medical practitioner, as almost nobody solicits their help when things are going ""wonderfully"".My newborn son was potentially afflicted with a life threatening illness, and the staff at Orange Coast ER was overwhelmingly supportive of his needs (almost everyone...there is always at least one exception at every medical facility:)They addressed hus situation, saw him immediately, and even assisted in arranging his transfer to a different facilty, that was determined to better suit the needs for his condition. Often money and ego can get in the way of a patient's best interest and care, and whether my positive review is the outlier, or the negative ones are, I believe that the people at Orange Coast ER put the needs of my child ahead of their own. And he might only be alive because of that selflessness and quick action.As long as you have doctors and a nursing staff who understands the needs of the patient outweigh their own, you will have excellent care at Orange Coast ER. And that was, at least, my experience and especially my family's experience with Dr. Yee :) If Dr. Yee is working the ER, you can be assured that you will get the very best of care possible.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Keiren Sparks,"This is for my mother's stay on the surgical unit, 3rd floor. She fell and broke her R hip Wednesday night, was taken to the ED and stayed there until she went to surgery on Thursday afternoon about 3pm (at least they got her a hospital bed). That was understandable, if she went upstairs she'd have less attention than when down in the ED since her hip was unstable and painful pre-op. Once upstairs post-op most everything was OK she states, but the discharge process left A LOT TO BE DESIRED. She was told she'd be moved to rehab at 1:30pm on Saturday but not one nurse or CNA came in before the ambulance came to transport her to help her get ready to go. Luckily I'm a healthcare provider and knew how to help her get washed a bit and dressed, and transfer to the bed-side commode...but I wasn't an employee...I wasn't getting paid to do that.After I had her dressed her RN comes in and says, ""Oh, they told me I have to change her dressing before she goes."" REALLY? you didn't know that until the ambulance guys got there? Delayed her leaving and subsequent admission to Hoag Newport Beach for rehab.I've been in healthcare 35 years and still can't believe the CNA didn't ask her all morning on Saturday to wash up....the laziness. My mom is Â 83 and has only been in the hospital 2x and maybe she didn't know she HAS TO ASK if she wants to wash up. After all, she fell on Wednesday night and it is now Saturday...think about how she feels? That's all I wanted to say.",3,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

If you can't bring them $5000 or $6000 cash they will cancel your procedure with only 1 days notice. You cannot make payment arrangements with them because like payday loan places they are predators.

Garry Mcclure,"BEWARE! Please please please avoid this ER if at all possible. Here's my story -After 3 months of fainting, trying to figure out the cause on my own, and my sister (who's a PA) hounding me constantly...I finally decided to go to the emergency 2 days after fainting 3 times...I came in with slurred speech, blurred vision, chest pain, feeling confused, and dizzy. After checking in and telling them my symptoms I was never offered a wheelchair to help prevent me from falling -- in fact I was asked 3 times to come back to triage and then walk back to the waiting room...without any help! On the 3rd call back the doctor asked me a few questions and without even examining me told me it was anxiety and that he'd run some blood panels and then send me on my happy way with anti-anxiety medication. I let him know that while I was stressed in that moment that it most definitely wasn't anxiety or an anxiety attack (I've had those I know what they are!) I was sent back to the waiting room where I called my sister and told her what they were saying...I was so upset, I haven't been to the emergency room since I was 15 and it felt like such a slap in the face to have my concern discounted by this doctor.Thankfully, my sister and her husband called the Director of the emergency room and they threw the most amazing bitch fit and my concerns were finally being taken semi-seriously. But it makes me question what if I didn't have that amazing and knowledgeable support? The doctor gave me some BS line of ""we don't usually see people your age with symptoms like this"" as his excuse for the way he had previously treated me.I was later admitted to the hospital where I had sub-par treatment. I had multiple non-sustainable vt (which were not documented anywhere in my chart by the nurses and I have pictures of to show my pcp when I see her next week). I had insanely low blood pressure that dropped even after they gave me 2 bags of fluid and was discharged the next day without any solution and was simply told I should drink more water and increase my salt intake.

After a week of finishing Tamiflu, I started developing this itchiness all over my body. I came into this ER to address this problem the first night. However, I also disclosed with them how I was also on Rifampin. But being on Rifampin, I was already being on watch by the OC Health Agency. Instead of looking into the issue that was concerning me that night, the Dr kept talking over me &amp; saying that I HAVE TB. I don't! I kept on telling him that &amp; after ALL the tests that he did for TB, it turns out I DONT HAVE TB. But that didn't solve my problem. He let me leave with my itchy problems without even saying anything about it and diagnosed me something else that I DONT ACTUALLY HAVE. Prescribed me another set of antibiotics that only made the situation worst. Now my whole body is covered in hives &amp; my whole face is swollen. I went back there again to the ER in the middle of the night because my situation only got worst Â even after steroids from an Urgent Care.

Jaskaran Matthams,"I have been at Orange Coast Memorial as a patient multiple times - once when my teratoma was diagnosed, once for a biopsy, once for my pre-op checkup, and once for my sternotomy. Each time I encountered a wonderful team of staff and felt I was in safe hands.After my surgery the nurses checked on me regularly to make sure I was comfortable and that I had everything I needed. Even the hospital food was great - I remembered having salmon with rice one day, ribs with mashed potatoes the next. A friend of mine who worked at another hospital couldn't believe it - she said the patients' food at her own hospital looked barely edible.One of my night-shift nurses, Debbie in the Cardiology wing, comes to mind as being absolutely exceptional. She answered my calls quickly and was always very courteous and professional. When I still had my chest tubes, she carried my drainage systems with me to the bathroom and back.

Kristina Justice,"This review is for the emergency department. I have used this ED for years for all of my families emergency medical needs. Â Yesterday, the dismissive attitude of the staff and physician, and the disrespectful way my family was treated was horrible. The physician did not listen to our concerns about my granddaughter and made my daughter feel like she was wasting his time. I will not use orange coast memorial for services anymore. I am a current hospital administrator and this behavior should not be tolerated. Â There is no way that this physician has good scores. This needs to be addressed and corrected. Customer service training is needed. Care is costly and there are many options to choose from. Convenience of proximity does not cut it. I will drive further to a center that cares about people and respects patients needs.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Aleesha Pickett,"PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BOOK ANY APPOINTMENT HERE.I came here because it is close to my work. However, they billed me for EVERYTHING. I have excellent insurance which never cost me anything for my yearly mammogram, but not this place! I received 4 different bills that they claim are owed and not covered. They called it a facility fee, radiologist reading fee, exam fee, and doctor fee. Unfreken believable. When you call their billing dept, they are prepared to take all these bogus charge calls and have total attitude. VERY disappointed in this place.

We got great service: nurses were very friendly and made my girl feel safe at 3:00 am.We were seen by the doctor within 15 minutes and knowing that we were visiting staff tried to help us as much as possible. They even found 2 doses of antibiotics for her to take before we would get home!Thank you!,5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Edie Calvert,"Never been there. Always went to Hoag. When paramedics took me there I recognized the RN in the ER. She crawled in my gurney with me and hugged me for a long time. You can't buy that care. Sandy needs an award! They went out of their way for me. Hoag wrote me off. Too many heart attacks, bypasses, stents, pacemwakers, kidney cancer and more. Sandy and the Doctors didn't treat me like they needn'tBother with me. Sandy fought for me and wouldn't give up on me. After nuclear stress test, ultra sound and x Ray they found enlarged heart. Only memorial care orange coast medical center would ever do that for me. Thank you Doctors, ER team and everyone else. They took the time to explain everything and made me feel like they really cared. I'm no longer using Hoag! Hoag has gone down hill and people like Sandy have made me feelLike I stand a chance!

Emyr Medrano,People don't usually want to be at the hospital for any issues however I've had to spend quite some time here with medical issues. I've had to spend time here because for family issues. The security team are by far the most amazing and caring team I've ever encountered. The security guard Dennis is extremely caring and compassionate and it's so evident in their service. Doctors and nurses are kind and so knowledgeable. The oncology unit is one of the best I've encountered. Really made a difficult time easier to deal with!! Oncology unit one of the best!,5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Tyreese Fletcher,"I had my daughter here 3 months ago and everything was great! This is the second (and last) child I gave birth to. My first child was born at Saint Marys hospital in Long Beach 7 years ago and BY FAR my experience at Orange Coast Memorial was the best! All the nurses were lovely, the Doctors were great. Everyone was so informative. I absolutely gained an immense respect towards Doctor Leathers who was in charge of giving me the epidural. She was so informative and nice! The woman who gave the epidural 7 years ago at Long Beach Saint Mary's was a complete bleeeep! Overall very happy with the services thank you!",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Travis Dyer,"My OB, Dr. Yen Tran, delivered my baby son on 8/23/18. It was an amazing experience. Dr. Tran made me feel absolutely comfortable throughout my entire pregnancy and during labor.

You can tell Kim is genuine and connects to you in a personal level. Had the best experience with these two by my side throughout my first time being pregnant. All my questions and concerns are always addressed in person and thru my chart. I can't express enough how lucky I am to have both Dr. Tran and Kim.

Kitty Manning,"I got really sick mid June and spent way more time here than I had ever spent in a hospital in my entire life. It got pretty depressing I had to say, even with my mom by my side the second time I was hospitalized. Nonetheless, the staff here made both of my stays durable and even somewhat enjoyable. The nurses and the aids are amazing, accommodating, patient, and were always encouraging. I was in both Surgery (I believe that's what it's called?) and Telemetry units, both of which were great! I only had one nurse that made me wait 15 minutes when I really needed to pee (I was too weak to stand up on my own). The rest of the stay was pleasant (depressing but pleasant). Yes you DO get depressed after spending 20 days in the hospital (5 days the first time, 15 days the second time). Overall, I hate this place because I don't ever ever ever want to go back to any hospital again, but if I have to, this place is it!",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Nimra Hunter,"BEWARE!!!!!! Before you decide to go to Orange Coast Memorial for any procedures, example, to their imaging center, they do not bill their procedures as a normal outpatient imaging procedure. They bill as a service through the hospital with your insurance will apply your deductible even if you're covered at 100% anywhere else. Usually I have my procedures at Hoge imaging Center and decided to go here because I was told by my doctors that they are less expensive, well that's CRAP! Because now I have a $300 bill because of their billing system. And I was told there is nothing they will do to correct it issue.Only go here if you want to walk away with an unexpected bill at the end!",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Myla Stout,"This review is based on my recent C-section experience with Labor &amp; Delivery. Â This was my first time using this hospital and I was NOT impressed...Firstly, the nurses are pretty relaxed around here. Â Compared to Fountain Valley hospital, it would appear that the nurses at Fountain Valley do 10 times the work as the nurses at Orange Coast. Â I truly feel bad for the Fountain Valley hospital nurses after seeing how easy and relaxing it is here for nurses at Orange Coast. Â You can hear nurses chit chatting to each other, telling each other how to plan their days because this and that patient are being discharged etc...It is a very nice and relaxing environment. Â It would appear that Fountain Valley hospital have 20 times the amount of patients than Orange Coast hospital....So I had a C-section and OMG I really did not like the female Egyptian anesthesiologist that they have here. Â That lady kept talking to other nurses about Egypt and all its glories, yet when she performed her numb medication on me I was truly in pain. Â Then she proceeded to cover my entire mouth and nose with the oxygen mask which made me feel like I was suffocating and I literally thought I was going to faint before the C-section surgery even start. Â Then after seeing me turning blue/purple or whatever color I was in, she then removed the mask and left it open at my nose area so I could breath. Â Then, the other doctors had to remind her to do her parts because she neglected them...In addition, her accent was so thick I could barely understand 5% of whatever she said...Let's make it clear that this is a non-profit hospital. Â I do not know if that is the reason for them being stingy on supplies. Â They don't give newborn any personal newborn items like Fountain Valley hospital e.g. pacifier, some towels, some baby items...They Â don't give you anything unless you ask for it. Â They also seem to be trained on pressuring you to breastfeed in an extremely demanding manner almost like forcing you to do so. Â Every time I asked to use a breast pump, the answer was, ""why do you need it?"" Â ""what is it for?"" Â ""No, you don't need that"" ""breast feed, breast feed and breast feed is what baby needs"" Â They are lucky that I am not against breast feeding but their forceful ways of telling people to breast feed is extremely annoying, out of line, and it's none of their business to dictate on that matter. Â If I had no life, no job, and all the time in the world to breastfeed my kids, that would be a dream come true. Â Unfortunately, I also have to go to work, and my employer don't give extra time for me to pump, and also I can't bring my kid to work with me so I can stick out my nipple for them to suck on demand so it would not work out the ways the nurses at Orange Coast seem so passionate on about forcing people to breastfeed.

Ella-May Ayers,"Had my beautiful daughter delivered at this hospital June 2017. Nurses (all but one) were fantastic, lactation consultants were so incredibly caring and eager to help. Â My biggest complaint is against the anesthesiologist. We can't remember her name but she was older and had a thick Russian accent. She was absolutely horrible!!! I don't know how she has a license but she needs to be REMOVED!!!!! She failed to administer my epidural properly and had to reinsert the needle THREE TIMES all while yelling at me to keep still (which I didn't BUDGE in fear of any nerve damage) and respond loudly. So she inserts the needle way too far to the left and I yell that it hurts to the left, then she inserts too far to the right and again yells while sighing loudly as if I'm a nuisance. She gets it on the third try finally after I'm sobbing. Both my husband and sister were asked to remain outside, they were horrified hearing her yelling. This is my second child and I can very well say this epidural was and is the worst experience of my life. On a side note, I now have sharp back pain at my epidural site that doesn't seem to be going away even at 7 months postpartum. PLEASE do yourself a favor and run the other way if you see this lady coming to give you an epidural!! She will literally ruin your entire birthing experience. Epidurals should NEVER be that painful nor should it be redone THREE times!! AND you SHOULD NOT HAVE BACK PAIN AT THE EPIDURAL SITE POST PARTUM! We had an amazing anesthesiologist at Kaiser for our first, the doctor was quick and precise, I didn't even know they inserted the epidural! She was done in a few minutes and no complications after! That is how your experience should be!!! On another side note: if you plan to get an epidural at this hospital, make sure to have the right nursing staff assigned to you also! We had a nurse who was older and very ""experienced"". She was very pushy about giving birth naturally and not needing an epidural. She gave us her two cents on how babies should be born without anything. That moms need to withstand the pain. That she did it naturally and all our parents did (not my mom thank you very much). She was great at disregarding any of my pain (I'm a silent laborer) and was rather quick to say it was in my head. After I finally got an epidural she was pretty adamant that I would not feel anything even though I very heavily felt back pain. I was able to move my legs easily and control my labor even with an epidural, she said that that was not possible and was in my head. My sister had to advocate for me the whole time, very exhausting.",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Eadie Whitmore,"On September 29th, I brought my husband to the hospital for severe vertigo. As a nurse, I know that vertigo can be a symptom of a stroke and felt due to how severe the symptoms were, it needed to be checked out. My husband was unable to even stand up and had to crawl to get to the car. He was brought back immediately and underwent several tests. While in the ER, he became bradycardic which I noticed, and the ER nurse did not (his heart rate went down into the 30s and he lost consciousness). She thanked me later for noticing his heart rate was so low. Really? They decided to admit him for further testing. He was admitted (or so we thought) to the Telemetry unit so he could be on a monitor. He had a brain MRI and an echocardiogram which came back negative. Flash forward to an almost $5,000 out of pocket bill...... the reason the bill is so high is because we were billed as if my husband was under observation status which is equivalent to being an outpatient. Thus, the insurance pays less and the patient pays more.Not once did anyone tell us he was an observation patient. Nothing in our paperwork indicates he was an observation patient. According to California law, every patient is to be notified of observation status in writing and this did not happen. Now my husband is being informed by the hospital that he must track down the doctor that made him an observation patient and have him change it to ""admitted"". He has called the doctor numerous times with no reply. We are extremely unsatisfied with our experience here. The patient should not be asked to chase down a doctor to rectify the hospital breaking the law. I hope this post helps another patient prior to this happening to them. Here is the link to the All Facilities Letter from the California Department of Public Health on Senate Bill 1076 that stipulates that hospitals must notify patients of observation status both verbally and in writing: cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCâ¦",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Lauryn Vasquez,"When I explained that I came to the ER because I had severe pain behind my knee (probably due to a herniated disc on my back), the receptionist rushed me to give her my id, and at the same time told me to fill out a form, and at the same time she asked me for my social security number. I was in pain and overwhelmed. When I told her ""one thing at a time"", she gave me a big speech. I was pretty uncomfortable because I had to tell my medical history in front of all these people sitting less than 2 feet away in a crowded room behind me. The waiting room is very small and if you value your privacy, this is not the right place for you.When they brought me back to the ""patient room"" actually it was a bed in the corridor with a bunch of people walking around the patients. The doctor looked at me for 1 second and said my leg did not appear swollen, then he lift my blouse and examined my spine. I thought this was very unprofessional. Dr Denis seemed to be trying to get rid of me, making me feel badly that I came to the ER. But I think this is a scam. They admit a lot of people, and probably short staffed, the doctors get rid of people quickly in order not to work overtime. Although I am in my 60s Dr Denis did not even check my heart or the back of my left that was extremely painful. If you are not bleeding badly don't bother going to this ER, they will see you for less than 2 secs, charge your insurance company for the work they actually did not do.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Georgina Durham,"First I went to Saddleback who improperly scheduled me for a mammogram, I was there for an MRI. They were rude and I left crying.Then I went to Hoag who had the tiny, long tube machine and they send you an head-first like you're in a coffin with your back smashed up against the top of it. I'm not a large woman and it was very scary. Frankly, I had a panic attack. I wasn't able to do the procedure at all. I asked them if there was an open MRI for the type of MRI I was having and they said no. I did my own research and found Orange Coast memorial. Thank God because they have a much bigger opening so you feel less scared and it's a shorter machine so your head can be out. I didn't have a panic attack, the procedure was 20 minutes shorter than Hoag's would have been and the staff was absolutely fantastic. In fact, the radiologist even called me on my way home and gave me the results of my MRI. I'm just so pleased and so thankful that I found them.

Arian Barker,"I had the worst experience giving birth to my second child here. First of all, the nurses are not accommodating idating at all. No one helped mE to the bathroom Â while I was on an epidural, no one listened to me, etc. speaking of the epidural, they made my whole top half of my body feel numb instead of my bottom half. When I expressed my concers they said it was because I was anxious and nervous probably. Which wasn't true. I asked to get it taken out but they Â failEd to do so until another nurse came on duty and realized I was not okay. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't focus, I was bad. Then when it came tome to actually push, nnoone was around. My husband asked for nursees multiple times and the nurse said ""if she needs to push then she caN push."" Meanwhile no nurses were in the room. So I guess I was supposed to deliver my own baby. As my baby was halfway out, the dr on hand (in case your dr doesn't make it) was cracking jokes trying to get me to look at her coming out and waving her hand everywhere. Not quite the position I wanted to be in with a bunch of strangers around me. It was the most embarrassing moment. Â Once I got settled to the new room to recover, I got checked maybe twice the whole two days I was there and it was so hard to get a damn Advil.

Jorge Delaney,"This Medical Center is clean and easy to get to. They offer free valet parking which is great considering the parking lot is usually full. While appointments to see a gynecologist for my well-woman exam were not available for months, I was able to book an appointment with a midwife who conducted my well-woman exam and answered many questions for me about changing my birth control method. I saw Denise Castellano to have nexplanon implanted. Again, the appointment was very easy to make and very quick. She is such a sweet woman and does an amazing job explaining everything and walking you through what she's doing step by step. I swear this lady gave me a hug when she came into the room for my appointment! If she still around by the time I'm ready to have children, she'll be my go-to, since she's a midwife and works at the hospital just across the parking lot. This facility and their Urgent Care on Beach Boulevard are my go-to for medical care. I have only lived in California for 3 years and can't say I've experienced more professional care anywhere else.Oh and for those complaining about cost, my nexplanon cost me a $50 copay and $5 out of pocket...

Tommy Halliday,"My aunt needed to have her gallbladder removed. The head nurse told us that she was going to be in surgery at 3:30pm . They called us at 1pm to say they moved the surgery so we had to drop everything and nobody cared about calling us ahead of time to let us know about the time change . This hospital has the worse communication ever they throw around the ""I'm sorry's "" like it's going to make a difference. God forbid that I needed to go to a hospital and this would be the only one to go to,I rather die.",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Baran Lim,"Rudest call operators ever. I go to the the women's center for ob/gyn and they are not rude at all. Everyone was transferring me to the wrong department telling me I'm calling the wrong place, well clearly you can't direct calls so why are you even operating the phones? You also don't speak English, and when you find someone that does you act all rude like this isn't your job and it's such an inconvenience. Maybe go over operating procedures and how to talk to patients in a calm manner and stop yelling over someone who is looking for help. Worst experience ever.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Parker Daugherty,"I had my son here and they did deliver my son safely. They provided good service and some nurses were awesome. However, they did not respect my religious beliefs. They have one way to operate and one way only depending on the situation. No natural birth support or male doctor ""not invited"" in to see your private parts. The biggest complaint I have is the way they treated my aunt in the hospital. She doesn't speak English but there were many of us to help translate. She was told by racist nurses that she was so depressing to them and such a burden. My aunt was having hemorrhaging and just had a dangerous fall from her bed. She is weak and anemic and needs a lot of assistance. They didn't want to help her get up or attend her at all. The lady (patient) next to her was complaining all the time about EVERYTHING and the nurses took the lady's side making my aunt the culprit. Everyone in the family was invited to see the other lady (patient) but the nurses were upset that there was more than 2 visitors for my aunt (my son and I were the extra visitors!). I was flabbergasted on how they had the audacity to treat my aunt with such disrespect. My aunt is really sick for crying out loud! I am a part of Memorial and am seriously thinking of switching to some other medical group.

Rosemarie O'Moore,I just have to commend the staff in the ER. My wife brought our son into the ER because he fell off the monkey bars at school and had a hole in his lip from biting through. So I was thinking this would take forever because I've gone to other ERs before like Fountain Valley where I had to wait hours before anyone saw me.I was met with out nurse right away Kelly who was very attentive and he even brought me coffee when I told him how tired I was from working all day. The PA who helped us was super quick too stitching him up. Also one of the guys who helped clean up my son his name was David was super gentle and patient I couldn't believe that my son didn't even cry! I can't imagine going to any other ER now and I will tell everyone in my family that this is the only place they should be going to,5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Dakota Decker,"This review was sparked by the discovery of our ""case manager's"" failure to keep our conversations discrete and in confidence. Shortly after our son was discharged from the NICU, we found out that our ""case manager"" had told our NICU nurses regarding our conversation about a transfer to a different hospital. First of all, we only asked if this was an option since we did have some issues w/ the NICU. We never proceeded to take any major steps or even discuss major steps w/ her. Never the less, these conversations were supposed to be confidential. Â We also found out the nurses were offended by this. I don't blame them, but they shouldn't have known in the first place. Thinking back, it did feel like we weren't as welcomed there. Now we know why. We found this very unprofessional. On top of this, we had a minor issue w/ her when we first delivered. She had a hard time working out the details of my wife's breast pump. Calling her back 3 weeks later for updates, she didn't even know who we were!You may want to know what was so bad about our NICU stay that we wanted a transfer? There were a few issues, none that we weren't able to work out. Â Not going into details and not naming particular nurses... Most of the issues were regarding noise level. At times it was very loud. Some nurses louder than others. There's a color-coded led light noise monitor which didn't seem to deter them. But we did talk to the head nurse and things were much better afterwards. This would have been a non issue had we only stayed for a week or two but our poor boy was born very early and our stay spanned well over.I'll conclude by giving them some praise. Don't get my previous statements wrong, there were soo many great nurses here. They all played a key role in our son's development and early discharge. In the day shift, Pat whom cared for my son most of the time was very good. She was very gentle and experienced and always made us felt welcomed. Eva was also a top tier nurse although my son didn't have much opportunity with her. In the night shift, there were a handful: Reesa, Mai, Sharline, Nen. And last but not least, our delivery nurse Deena was such a delightful nurse, very gentle and warm.",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Nola Mcdonald,"God is Good and I was blessed to have such caring and genuine care today especially from the PA in the ER, Christine, Alexandria my nurse! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I have never felt so much care from a Emergency Room, I usually feel uncomfortable because of my autoimmune disease GOUT with my joint pain being so bad, but she made me feel very comfortable and understood every part of my condition. Having GOUT is an ongoing battle and unfortunately I feel that some medical care facilities make me feel uncomfortable like I'm just looking for medication. My condition is real and I have never expressed so much gratitude for a ER until today! Even if I get an attack in LA or far away I will always hope to come here to this hospital or I'll just wait to come back home to OC.

Stevie Cobb,"Not really happy with the customer service received here by the staff. After my mom came out of an extremely long procedure, not one nurse or Dr. Had the common decency to tell us she was okay or how it went. After they failed to provide any closure we were called to visit her in recovery. Still no update. Upon arrival at recovery, we were told only one person could go in there. The nurse was VERY rude. I highly suggest you schedule your surgery elsewhere. I'm fuming with anger. No one should ever be treated in such manner when there family members life is on the line.Day two and I feel the need to post an update: I walked in to see my Mom. Two nurses were standing around gossiping about a patient who had requested anxiety medication and laughing. Apparently this is an everyday occurrence judging by other people's yelp reviews. This is really disturbing as their main job is to tend to the patients concerns without judgment. I can not state it enough, DO NOT COME HERE. I can't wait to get my Mom out!

Siobhan Holder,"Absolutely HORRIBLE! This review is solely for the Emergency Room ONLY!! I had a medical emergency and chose this hospital, since it's close to home and my pain management specialist's office is located in the main hospital building. First off...the ER staff! The females were too busy gossiping about a nurse and sharing her pictures off her social media page to one another. They were loud and obnoxious! Then the triage nurse was so arrogant and opinionated. She was an older white woman, with bright red and short hair. She really upset me, but since I was feeling awful I decided to wait. She provided me with a cup for a urine sample. I walked into the restroom and was immediately disgusted. The floor had blood and so did the toilet. You would think a hospital would be held to higher standards and know about how biohazard blood is. Once I was called in (four hours later) the young man that escorted me was walking extremely fast and he never made eye contact. All he said was, ""take a seat, someone will be with you shortly"". I took a seat and I waited and waited, until finally...the doctor showed up. I was shocked, because from my experience I always talk to a nurse before the doctor. Anyway, I wasted my time. The doctor said that although I was extremely ill, he could not treat me because I already see a therapist for my condition. What a waste of my time and insurance money. No one ever treated me, nor did they even test my urine. I've never had such a horrible and negative experience at a hospital before.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Reo Johnson,"This review is for the Quest Diagnostics Lab in suite 2100 only. Â This facility is easy to access from the freeway and the parking was easy (albeit there were only a few spots left in the lot, I did see a parking structure as well). I was able to make an appointment the day before for an appointment. Usually going to a Quest for walk in is a straight up nightmare in my experience. i've waited for HOURS with a walk in, so I was skeptical that an appointment would have me seen on time.There were only 2 people ahead of me - I'm not sure if this is the regular light crowd or if it was a slow day.. Their computer systems were down and they were experiencing some light construction. With those set backs, I was seen about 10 minutes after my appointment (I checked in about 10 minutes before the appointment).My phlebotomist, Cindy, was very kind. She asked if I was doing ok about half way through (even though I wasn't showing signs of stress or anything) and as the usual routine goes, told me before the needle went in and came out. It was pretty painless. I think I'll try this location next time I need to get blood work done",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Caden Tierney,"Two parts to this review... Billing and Labor and Delivery Labor and Delivery: FIVE STARSI'll keep this short and sweet. My delivery nurse (who had been there for about 30 years) and The baby's Nurse (who treated my son like she would her own. She was so happy and excited for us, being a mom herself it's like she was reliving her own kids' births. I loved that about her.) were the absolute sweetest. All of my other nurses (I feel like I had many- maybe 4 others, were all great too) Nice small intimate setting and quality service. No issues at all with staff. They were all wonderful! Billing: Where to begin..?? Had our first daughter at Hoag and our son here at OC Memorial in FV. Just because it's a smaller hospital than Hoag and it's in Fountain Valley, DON'T BE FOOLED. It will cost you more to have a baby here. I was told over the phone that our labor and delivery bill would be well less than 10k, but it was not. It was 11k. This is for a standard delivery, no issues, one overnight stay. This change did not include my Ob's delivery charge. (Luckily our insurance covered most of my OB care, which was just one charge from pre and post). With Hoag, I was able to negotiate a 15% lower price (if we paid the balance in cash within 24 hours) since after our deductible, we still owed around 5k. That helped us out a lot! Yay Hoag!!!! Awesome customer service. With Orange Coast, after my husband and I with our kids, sat down with a billing specialist, told us they don't lower a bill or do any sort of negotiating, because they are a non for profit hospital. This is because WE HAVE INSURANCE. Now, had we been cash paying, there is a very good chance that we would not have been charged 11k, but in fact only charged a percentage of that amount. The lady told us that the amount would be lower had we paid in cash. I regret even telling them we had insurance. Then I probably could have done some negotiating. Something for you all to keep in mind. So good job, take advantage of the people with insurance, whom on top of their monthly premium, still have to meet their deductible before any benefits kick in. With Hoag, there was a labor and delivery fee, room and board and then my OB delivery charge. That is all. With Orange Coast, every single thing you can possibly imagine was billed and there were some categories that seemed to be repeated, but the billing specialist reassured me that they were all different, separate categories. It was a four page bill. Very overwhelming. The other thing that bothered us was that we received a bill for our baby's hearing test. A standard and universal procedure. We were told that our insurance was in network but the reason we were charged a percentage of the hearing screening (180$) was because the company they used was out of our network. This is their fault, not ours therefore we shouldn't have had to pay a dime. We should not have been told that the hospital was in network if a service provided was not. Overall, the staff was great and I do like that the hospital was smaller than Hoag, but service at Hoag was good too and it cost us way less in the end to have our baby there.",3,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Che Mercado,"Labor and delivery. The one important thing about having a baby is the details of your hospital. OC memorial beats FV hospital. I gave birth at both and wish I had gone to OCM from the beginning. First off, parking. The structure is in back so you park near the child center for easy access. However, going into labor between like...9pm-6am or somthing like that, the doors will be locked and you have to go through the front of the hospital ER. Then they wheel u back to L&amp;D. The delivery rooms are cozy and a bit small. But everything you do is in that room. The nurses are very warm loving ladies. I wanted a bow hat for my girl, so the nurse made me one even though they dont have them. The L&amp;D dept gets their own anesthesiologist so no sharing with the rest of the hospital. Now the biggest concern of all, semi-private rooms. There are only a few private rooms, so most likely youll get a semi-private room. If its busy, they put you in the room with someone who is leaving next day and dont fill the room for the remainder of your stay. I got lucky and had a baby when they werent busy. But i still got a semi-private room. Hubby got a bed at least. The showers were not fun. The nozzle is low like for wheel chairs. I guess they want you sitting when you shower. The food is like any other hospital. They had a vietnamese option which is more like rice instead of mashed potatoes and rice porridge for soup. Regardless, you have so much good food surrounding the hospital. In regards to the recovery nurse, they were ok. They pretty much left us alone. There is quiet time from 2-4pm. If you have guests, they will be kicked out. Mine were not, maybe the nurses use that for their quiet time too lol. I chose to breastfeed and give formula, so they brought me an electric pump with tons of new parts and a case of formula. Baby and me were fully stocked, i came home with enough to last me 2 days. I even got to take the new madela pump parts and collustrum bottles home, just not the actual machine.

Sol Boyd,"I am writing this review in regard to my experience at Orange Coast Memorial for my gastric bypass surgery performed by Dr. Ali and overnight stay. Originally I was scheduled to have my surgery at Fountain Valley Hospital. After reading the horrid reviews on that hospital I requested for my services to be transferred to Orange Coast Â On January 18, 2017 I had gastric bypass surgery performed on me. This review will be on the entire experience.The valet parking was awesome, what a convince. The admission check in was a breeze and staff was polite. After check in was completed the valet staff called for a gentleman to take us to the surgery department via tram. Once in the surgery department a friendly gentleman checked me in, advised me and my husband of my surgery time and explained to him how to follow the monitor on my progress once called back for pre op. So far so good. Once into the pre op my experience changed. My pre op RN (Wish I could remember her name) was down right rude. Her bed side manner was terrible and she was extremely short with my husband when he came back to wait with me. For me this was a huge deal and I was nervous, the mannerism of this RN did not help with that but instead heightened it. Even my husband said she was rude to him. Of course at that point I was now wondering after all if I made the right decision by switching from Fountain Valley. My surgery was scheduled for 1pm but the surgical team did not come and meet with me until about 3pm. To me this was not really an issue. I understand factors or complications with patient prior to me can effect the surgery time. My issue was having to wait in the pre op with a rude RN. When the surgeon, RN that would be in my surgery room and the anesthesiologist came to let me know it was time for me I was so relieved. Dr Ali is great, personable and patient. He answered all my and my husband's questions. The surgery team was great as well. My experience in the recovery room is fuzzy so I am unable to leave a review. My husband did say however, all the staff were very nice. I was so happy with my room as I got lucky and was assigned to a solo room. The attending staff for my stay in the hospital were nice. They answered all questions and helped with anything I asked for. My experience with my discharge the next day was not favorable. I felt completely rushed. The nurse who discharged me did not really go over my discharge instructions. Of course I was tired and not thinking to straight with the medications and the pain I was experiencing so all the questions I needed answered I did not think of until I went home. In summary, if my experience with the pre op RN and my discharging nurse were better I would definitely give this hospital a 5 star. With these negative experiences I can only rate this hospital at a 3. I am unsure if these reviews really make a difference to management. If they do I would recommend pre op staff be coached on their attitudes. These RN's are the front line and are who patients see before their operation. The experience with the pre op staff can set the whole tone for a patient. Stress and feelings of wondering if you chose the right hospital right before surgery stink.",3,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Harlow Powell,"Worst, most frightening experience of my life. I had a tiny non-cancerous cyst which needed removal. My primary physician recommended that I have a cosmetic surgeon perform the procedure, instead of a dermatologist, because this was a facial cyst. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of seeing Dr. Thuam Nguyen of Fountain Valley at ORANGE COAST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.Upon his initial examination, Dr. Thuam Nguyen assured me that it was a simple 20-30 minute procedure, using a local pain block. I had cysts removed before and that was the usual protocol. Nguyen then said that I would have to check into the hospital because he lacked an operating room in his office, which was acceptable.Then the real 'fun' started...Nguyen's office and the hospital must have called to re-schedule my surgical dates and times at least 6 times.The morning of my operation, Nguyen's office manager called to say that he had a Â cancellation and asked me to arrive 3 hours earlier than scheduled. She said that he was always punctual, so ""please don't be late!"". I agreed and checked-in on time.Ended up 'Dr. Punctuality' was three 3 hours late.While I was stuck waiting for hours in pre-op, two Asians, one was a 50-something woman who introduced herself as my anesthesiologist, the other was a young 30-something male (introduced himself as her assistant) and asked me if I wanted a general anesthesia. I said,""absolutely not; Dr. Nguyen already agreed to a local.""The self-identified female 'anesthesiologist' laughingly said,""Why you no like Michael Jackson juice?!"" (referring to Propofol that killed Michael Jackson and Joan Rivers). The use of Propofol should not be taken lightly and is no laughing matter.FACT: Propofol was developed in Israel for LETHAL INJECTIONS.FACT: The Missouri Supreme Court uses it to execute prisoners condemned to death. Her male 'assistant' kept up the pressure to have me consent to a general anesthetic (more $ for them). Again, I adamantly refused. (Where was my doctor?!)They kept pushing EVEN AFTER I EXPLAINED (AGAIN) THAT I WAS ALREADY ON A DAILY REGIMEN OF PAIN MEDICATION, BETA-BLOCKERS (TO SLOW MY PULSE), and BP PILLS TO DECREASE MY BLOOD PRESSURE. Adding a 'cocktail' of extremely strong sedatives to this mix could have caused permanent brain damage, and at the worst, death. It was becoming more evident that these white-coats were putting me in harm's way for profit. And why was Dr. Nguyen no where to be found to tell these people what he told me: that a topical pain block, like Lidocaine would suffice.It appeared that this last minute hospital bait-and-switch was financially-driven -- for the anesthesiologist and perhaps an extra side-bonus for Nguyen as well. Nearly 3 hours after I had arrived, Dr. Nguyen casually strolled in (with no apology for being late). I was then rolled into the operating room and the next thing I remember is a mask was being shoved onto my face while I shouted ""NO!"". Â I tried to avoid it by quickly nodding my face sideways. My arms were strapped down on the stretcher so I was unable to defend myself by pushing the mask away. Then I blacked-out.5 hours later, I awoke in a post-op daze, horrified and angry that I had been treated worse then an animal. Because I had so many strong medications already in my system, and then more were added, I became sick. My friend had to move into my home and stay with me for a week because I was virtually bed-ridden. When I was finally able to drive again, about 2 weeks later, I drove to the hospital to pick up my medical records, AND the anesthesiologist's report (which is a separate document, picked-up in another office). The report confirmed that they gave me enough drugs to kill an elephant. It's an absolute miracle that I survived.Thank God, I made it. No one should be abused like that - EVER! I noticed that the majority of patients were non-English speakers, mostly Spanish. My friend witnessed how they were being insensitively mishandled in the waiting room. Perhaps I lived to Yelp to warn people about this incident, or start a patient's advocacy group.PLEASE CALL YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO COMPLAIN IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ABUSE.oag.ca.gov/consumersI filed a formal complaint with the hospital and my insurance company. They said that there was an investigation underway. The result: I received a letter of apology from the hospital. It's all about numbers. If enough people speak up, then the bad guys will be stopped from hurting, perhaps killing more people.The OC Register listed this hospital for Medi-Cal billing abuse. They're still sending me an erroneous bill for an unnecessary EKG (another case of double-billing) since Medi-Cal already paid them. $14,000.00 to remove a tiny cyst!Be careful, stay healthy by eating properly and exercising. Stay out of the ER unless it's absolutely necessary.Most important: if you value your life, stay out of this specific hospital!",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Perry Barber,"I am so grateful that I delivered my child at the Center for Childbirth at Orange Coast Memorial. Â I had originally wanted to give birth at Hoag but after learning that Hoag had a higher caesarean section rate than OCMMC did, I'm glad that my insurance had me deliver here instead.The nurses were warm and compassionate. Â Danielle in L&amp;D is one of the best nurses I have EVER encountered. Her bedside manner is remarkable and she's a huge asset to the OCMMC team. I was working towards a completely natural Bradley Method childbirth and she worked with me every step of the way to make my dream possible. Any time a situation arose that required providing informed consent, she took the time to advise me of all risks and benefits of our decisions along the way. It meant so much that she believed in me and what I was trying to accomplish even if I was one of the most ""strong willed"" patients they've had. :) Â Geri in Post-Partum was also one of the best nurses I have ever had. Â She was so encouraging and compassionate. Â I felt very connected to her as a patient and she was so sweet to my perfectly healthy newborn son. I feel fortunate that she was looking after us.Lori, the lactation consultant is also fantastic! Â She worked closely with my son and I to ensure we had the best bfing relationship possible. She was so helpful and supportive and I so appreciate her efforts to make sure we had all the resources and tools we needed. Â I had several private appointments with her and she was great. Highly recommend her.These nurses are a huge asset to the OCMMC team and made my experience there so wonderful. Â I was concerned when I found out that I wouldn't be delivering at Hoag Newport, but it turned out being one of the most serendipitous things that ever happened to me. I could not have had a more magical experience there!My only suggestion is to have the newborn photo photographer let the parents know up front that the photos she'd be taking were for photo packages. It seemed a little shady that she made it seem like she'd be taking free photos, then put on a whole sales pitch. It's a little much for new parents facing the expense of a brand new child.

Mckenzie Howarth,"My wife just had a C-section at this hospital. Now that we have been to the maternity ward and ER of both Hoag and Orange Coast I have a frame of reference for comparison...PROS: Spouse (or partner) can sleep in the same room in an actual bed as long as the hospital is not too busy (bed space is limited to 21 beds but the hospital was not that busy when we were here; we missed the full moon by a few days). At Hoag you get an uncomfortable cot to sleep on. The night nurses were great - very attentive and a great bedside manner. There is a bit more of a personal touch whereas at Hoag you were more of an ant among billions of ants. Proximity was a big plus for us as we live only 3/4 mile away and I could shuttle my son back and forth to see mom and the new baby. Hoag was better at educating new parents offering special classes and making birth parents watch a series of videos. Parking is free - Hoag charged $20 for a weekly parking pass or $8 per day. CONS: Only one meal for dad - Â Hoag had at least one meal a day for birth partner. Some of the day nurses were like legacy airline flight attendants - knowledgeable and experienced but a ""my way or the highway"" mentality, we missed the waterfront view we had at Hoag, the Labor and Delivery rooms were much nicer at Hoag, the common areas are not lavish like a 4-star hotel. We had an experience at the ER at Hoag on a Friday evening (maybe around 7 pm) where we have to wait 3-4 hours to get in. At Orange Coast we went to the ER at 3 am on a Saturday and there was virtually no wait. The doctors and staff were very friendly and helpful.We would definitely come back to this hospital for our next baby (we love Hoag too) but prefer the ER at Orange Coast.",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Mandeep Partridge,"So let's go back, this hospital definitely did a 180 and worked to rebuild my trust with them. After the previous post I had two very nice women come to ask me about my experience (Lynn and Mary) who both were very attentive. What I liked most is they didn't belittle the ways I was feeling or try to excuse it, they simply accepted it and made efforts to remedy this situation. Thank you ladies! So often the hardest part is simply being heard and believed without someone trying to diminish the validity of how you feel. They then brought me down to the OR, because surprise surprise! I was on the schedule to have my gall bladder out. :) I think they may have hand picked Elizabeth for me to repair the damage of my previous experiences. Elizabeth, without you I wouldn't have made it through! She literally held my hand while I cried and processed through my fears about what was about to happen. She was grace and kindness itself with me and before the doctor even made it in to see me, she had me laughing and calm again. Well played Lynn, Mary and Sue! She was wonderful! Had all my interactions been with Elizabeth or people like her my entire review would have been 100%! However, I won't allow the actions of three to skew the way I feel about everything else. Dr. Murray was amazing, efficient and calm, as was the rest of my team. As someone who was alone and scared, thank you! I'm now in recovery with both Cathy and Joselito who have been nothing but attentive and accommodating. What a way to turn an experience around. Thank you very much! And thank you Lynn, Mary, Sue and Beth got actually listening and making this experience not only no longer a negative but into a positive.

Hope Conroy,"Have an emergency? Â Don't go here! Â Go to Hoag if you can. My sister had to go to the ER because of a surgery she had there and the incision from the surgery was infected. Â She got to the ER around 2pm and they sent her outside in the cold - want to know how long it took for her to get a bed? She finally got a bed at 9PM! Â My sister was sitting there with blood oozing out with her shirt drenched in blood - crying in tons of pain. Â After hours of waiting in the tent, they brought her into a hallway in the hospital to wait for a bed to be available. Â They lifted her shirt and was looking at her wounds in front of everyone passing by in the hallway which was really embarrassing for my sister. Â They sat her outside of the break room for the staff and while waiting, she and my mom had to listen to male nurses/doctors talk about other women employees in the break room in a crude and disgusting way. Â The things they were saying were so unprofessional and rude. Â Anyways, my sister sat in that hallway for the longest time until they finally told her she needed to be admitted. Â They had a room ready for her for over an hour but workers kept saying ""I'll find someone to take you up to your room."" And then they would walk away and not come back. Â So, after that nightmare, my sister was waiting for her doctor who performed the surgery to check on her - but the PA said he would be in first thing in the morning to see her. Â Guess what? Â We waited at the hospital alllllll day and finally they said that no one even contacted the doctor because they forgot!

Ariya Hastings,"The tale of two hospitals .Base off of a mile to two mile difference in the city of Fountain Valley lies Orange Coast Hospital and Fountain Valley Hospital.One can heal you Â while Â the other could potentially kill you with their crusty doctors , dirty environment and incompetent staff.How many hospitals have I been to in the past year? 5 by now and by far this is my favorite hospital. I like the care received post surgery. I can't comment too much on the doctors since this was Â one of the hospital my grandmother's general doctor works for so Â we came here to schedule her surgery.I had already talked to her surgeon multiple times and was familiar with his educational background so I wasn't afraid about having a bad doctor. My grandma has been her twice , once in ICU and telemetry on the 3rd floor Â towards the side that tends to Â cardiac patients.On the cardiac side it's a 4:1 patient to RN which is always a plus. A lot of the hospitals in the area have huge patients to RN ratios and it's just not feasible to give patients the care they deserve.ICU:I can't say this is my favorite ICU, the rooms are very dark and Â not centered around the nurses' station. In terms of attention, I felt that the nurses here just showed up sporadically , they weren't as attentive as the ones around garden grove and UCI medical. I guess I just expected them to be more personable but they did their job so that's all that matters.Telemetry:I total love the care! Granted I had a nurse that was a bit creepy but overall the other nurses where so attentive and quick in response to my grandmother's needs. The CNA kept her clean and that's a big deal. In hospital people have greasy hair or bad breath because they aren't well cared for.Pre-op room:Jennifer in the pre-op room is feisty but I like her no bullshit attitude.Waiting area for surgery updates:Now the last time my grandmother had surgery was at UCI , and at UCI there was a waiting room that gave updates to the surgery progress. You can look at a screen with a patient's code number to know what's going on with your love ones. Using that Â experience as a bench mark OCMMC really lacks in that respect. Your essentially just sitting outside for the longest time not knowing whats happening until the doctor comes out. My family was waiting for 2 hours after my grandma was out of surgery until I ask the front receptionist when we are able to see her.Just not as efficient as I would like.Bottom Line:Orange Coast memorial is a great hospital in my opinion given the experiences I had here:the hospital is Â clean,the nursing staff aren't idiots , the hospital is applying for magnet. Granted, I don't think all the doctors here are great. I have seen the asshole who was my grandmother's doctor when she was at Fountain Valley hospital actually roaming the halls. Apparently that dick wad works here , probably scamming people off Family Choice HMO ( BTW WHICH IS AN HMO NO ONE SHOULD HAVE PERIOD).

Tanner Braun,"If I can give them zero stars I absolutely would. This hospital employs the laziest nurses I've ever seen and I've seen my share of hospitals throughout my life unfortunately. They are rude and lazy to your face and behind the curtains. So F*****g unprofessional. I can't believe the things I heard them saying..speaking out loud about such unprofessional things. Example: in the emergency room, where I can guarantee not a single person would Preferably be there rather than in their warm beds, who are in a lot of pain and scared, the nurses, trainees and front desk are LOUDLY speaking about zodiac signs (I hadn't been checked on in over 45 min) and birthdays and cackling about their boyfriends. 2nd example: during discharge, after a nurse closed the curtain started speaking loudly about how unfair this is and how tired they are and how ""it never ends"". I understand it's a hard job, but I can guarantee none of these people wanna be here willingly nor did anybody ask you to take this job. Â 3rd example is that after 4 days of being in the hospital, not a single documentation of my entire stay as of medications or anything has been recorded nor communicated to any nurse.

Lesley Hughes,"This review is for Lori, the lactation consultant, Ginger in labor and delivery, and Char in post partum. These nurses are amazing and the care they provide is of the highest quality. They care for their patients and go above and beyond. I feel so fortunate to have had my birth experience here under their care. You can tell it is not just a job for them and truly care and have compassion for their patients. I cannot say enough good things about these women named. I'd like to nominate them for a daisy award but do not see the information online.Unfortunately, our NICU experience was the exact opposite. One nurse in particular who has a bad reputation among the staff soured our experience here. I do not understand why she is still working here. I agree with other reviewers that this center is not pro breastfeeding and pro skin to skin, despite their claims. A vast amount of research exists that reports skin to skin and breastfeeding are life changing and life producing for babies in the NICU. However, this is not the atmosphere created in the NICU. New mothers are vulnerable and this mistreatment could lead to post partum depression. Parents are viewed as a nuisance. I hope your family does not have the unfortunate experience of having to have your baby in the NICU. If so, remain adamant about being with your baby, I wish I would have continued to do so. This nurse should be terminated for the unethical treatment she provides. I hope management views this and action is taken to remove this incompetent nurse.

My water broke very early in the morning, and after them pissing around for 4 hours and not checking me, they finally listened to me that I knew this was it. Being 19 they didn't respect me. The whole time they were telling me I needed an epidural because I didn't know what I was doing, I had already gone natural and was doing just great. I started getting a fever and the baby was in distress, so they FINALLY decided to check me and finish breaking my bag of waters. The doctor saw that there was meconium in the fluid and said nothing until very much later. More time went on and I got sicker and sicker to where I was blacking out, I do not remember the last hour of my labor, but I was given an epidural, and rushed for an emergency C section because they let me go too long, and it caused an infection for both the baby and I.In the operating room, the anesthesiologist asked to wait for her to use the restroom, which they did.. But as she came back and they were asking me if I could feel them poking me, I very clearly said yes because I could feel every Poke They said, sorry but we have to get started.

When I woke up in recovery I found out my baby had to be admitted to the NICU because he had an infection and needed a course of antibiotics.

He was born with a 102 fever because THEY didn't move things along sooner, and didn't mention til AFTER that they already knew he had gone to the bathroom inside.. To top it off, the NICU nurses, NEVER told me if they were doing any procedures on my baby. They moved his IV 4 times and I was never told about it until after they already did it.

Kacie Davidson,"This review is for the post partum ward. My experience with labor and delivery was absolutely phenomenal and not a single thing could have been better. However, once I got to post partum everything was different. OCM says they're a breastfeeding- supportive hospital but drastically failed to be supportive when I gave birth there in June. I was fed a ton of misinformation claiming I needed formula when I didn't and was never informed of things I should have been in order to prevent issues with breastfeeding later. Formula was heavily pushed when it did not need to be. A pump was never offered to me, even when my daughter was taken to the nursery for jaundice. I was told she would be brough to me for feedings when she was hungry and I had to call every single time and usually the nurses fought me on it saying she didn't need to eat and they already fed her even though they weren't supposed to. On top of failing in such an important area for me, the nursing staff was very inattentive in post partum. My pain meds, after an emergency c section, were consistently late. I was told I needed to call for help every time I needed to use the bathroom and it would sometimes take close to an hour to get a nurse in the room when I had to pee.I gave them two stars because the hospital was very clean and my husband was able to stay with me some of the time because they had an empty bed. This is not always the case though, so don't count on that.If you know what you are doing as far as breastfeeding goes and you have a routine birth, your experience should be okish here, but as a first time mom with a c section birth, they really failed me and my daughter.",2,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

The labor and delivery nurses are all so wonderful (Ginger, Joanne, Jenny, Lori, Dawn, Veronica, Sarah, Robin) they made me feel very comfortable, answered all my questions and made the entire process seem like a breeze.

Nana Mcgill,"There are good things about this hospital and not so good. Â It's a beautiful campus (a little confusing though to find the right building).Surgery went very well - thank God. Â Waiting room staff were great and went out of their way. Waited about two hours to be called and allowed to go to recovery. Was told one hour.Had a hard time communicating with most Asian nurses. I thought speaking good English was a requirement. Â :(Had to go get a nurse because the roommate's IV was beeping for a while and nobody came to check it. Â Don't they get notified at their stations?Had to flag the nurse for a bedpan. Took another 15 minutes and 3 requests at their station for someone to come and remove it. Â Sad! Â What if I wouldn't have been there?Liquid diet comes - Unbelievable! Besides the tea, chicken broth (God only know what was in there), 4 type of juices from concentrate, frozen bar - I think it was Blue Bunny. Â Am not exact on the brand but I remember the ingredients: water, sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, junk flavoring... and Red 40, Yell0ow6, Blue 1, yellow 5. REALLY!

Shae Lara,"Words cannot give justice to how I truly feel about Dr. Reddy and her practice. I have the utmost respect for her and I owe her a debt of gratitude for the care she gave to me. I truly had my options in choosing who I wanted to direct my care and the first person that came to mind was Dr. Reddy as I have witnessed first hand her compassion and competence. My life literally flashed before my eyes when I was found to have an abnormality on one of tests. Feelings of shock, fear, confusion, and defeat took over me when I received the news. Immediately I turned to Dr. Reddy and she very calmly, efficiently, and systematically, pulled out all the stops to ensure that I received what I perceived as ""above and beyond the call of duty"" care. During my times of fear and anxiety she reassured me and helped me remain calm and focused. She wouldn't just listen to me, but she heard what I was saying and was sympathetic. She was my biggest advocate and supporter. When I was about to make a hasty Â decision on treatment, not listening to her recommendations against it, she did not relent but remained persistent, using various approaches, to give me clarity and it worked. I did not go through with that treatment which would not have been the best choice for me. Thereafter, I gave her complete control and she did not let me down. At the end of it, her recommendation was the best recommendation. Everything turned out as I prayed it would. It would have been different had I done my own thing. She remained professional and caring. She never demeaned me or made me feel that I was not qualified to decide on my medical care; rather, she spoke to me in a manner I could understand so I could be more informed. These are qualities that are hardly ever seen this day in age. These days, patients do not get random follow up calls from their doctor to check on them to see they're doing. Physicians don't sense your fear and then invite you into their office to help to relax you and tell you it's going to be okay. But Dr. Reddy does. She treats her patients as they are members of her family. She genuinely cares. She will fight for you. She will stand up for you. She will make sure that you get the best care that can be given because you are her patient and she expects nothing less for her patients. Thank you again, Dr. Reddy, for saving my sanity, and my life.As a added bonus, her office is located in the new pavilion building which makes getting radiology and lab tests done easy at Orange Coast Memorial. The radiology and laboratory staff are so friendly, welcoming, and calming. They work hard to make your visit as pleasant as and quick as possible.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Star Bishop,This rating is for their Imaging and Radiology department. I've had two ultrasounds done here. Both of my experiences were great from beginning to end. It was an easy process to call and schedule an appointment. The reception and registration staff are wonderful. They are friendly and efficient. The back office staff is professional and have a wonderful bedside manner. The exam rooms are quiet and clean. Â I dread having to take time out of my busy day to have any medical testing done.

Zain Park,"I was a patient at Orange Coast Memorial Ctr (Fountain Valley) Sept. 26-28 2016 (I had a full knee replacement). I have to say not only were my doctor's very considerate so were all the nurses &amp; entire team that cared for me during my stay. Any time they came in during the night they didn't flip on all the lights &amp; make a ton of noise to wake you up, they were very quiet, they only turned on 1 light that was closer to the door, if you were asleep..they would quietly knock on the door or on the cabinet until you woke up. They never startled you, it was a gentle awaking. Now let me compliment my team.....First: DIANE GARIOT, nothing short of amazing &amp; surprising. If you needed anything she was there before you could hit the call button, it was like she knew me for years &amp; my habits. She was very kind &amp; pleasant to chat with and never in a rush. Second: KATIE HENDRICKSON, what a ball of energy! She came bouncing into the room &amp; I totally felt her energy. She was always kind, smiling or laughing all day long (even though she was tired &amp; she was only half way thru her day). I loved being in her presence due to her energy, it made me feel like I could jump up &amp; RUN down the halls with my walker.Third: HALEY ERBES, she was so kind, polite &amp; always there at a moment's notice. I enjoyed talking with her &amp; listening to some of her life experiences. It seemed like I didn't get enough time with Haley or maybe I didn't need her as much but when I did....she was there immediately.Fourth: INES PAUL, she was so quiet. I only got 1 night with her &amp; she was very soft spoken, very quiet &amp; gentle. When she would scold me for not waiting til she got in the room to help me up out of bed she would do it in such a gentle way. She would always compliment you before she scolded you for ""not waiting for her"". I never had to ask her to refill my water or get new ice bags for my knee...she was there with everything I needed before I could ask. Last but not least JOHN PAUL, he was my first encounter when I got to my room. He made me feel like we had known each other for years, he was comfortable to be around, he was funny &amp; made my stay enjoyable. When I wasn't feeling well he knew how to cheer me up with a simple smile or a short joke (I've always said; ""laughter is the best medicine""). My first night after surgery was hard, my blood pressure dropped &amp; my leg went into spasms. John was always there with my med's on time, never late &amp; always polite. He would stand in the doorway &amp; make for sure I was ok since my spasms were pretty bad &amp; my blood pressure dropped too low. He was in touch with the dr &amp; when I was awake he'd explain what the dr had said. THANK YOU to my team of Nurses for taking such great care of me during my stay. Thank you for your support &amp; THANK YOU FOR CARING FOR THE SICK. It takes someone special to care for the sick &amp; elderly....I hope you all know how very special you are.Melanie Johnson",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Nico Espinoza,"Can not say enough good things about the ER staff! Have both of my parents outstanding care as did the staff in ICU and the floor. When my mom was critically ill the nurses took the time to educate me on what was happening and if my mom passed kindly prepared me that often the other spouse died soon after. When my dad was in ICU they let me sleep during shift change, normally a no-no. I had been sitting next to the bed holding my dad's hand &amp; I put my head on the bed and was out cold! When I woke up the nurse told me they realized how tired I was and was sleeping so soundly they felt I wouldn't hear a thing and I needed the rest. The hospital staff did a fantastic job of caring for both of my parents and educating me",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Tyler Dennis,"My wife is 24 weeks pregnant and recently woke up with chest pain and palpitations. We took her to Orange Coast Memorial ER and were met outside by the triage nurse, Jeff, who escorted us straight into the triage room. After taking her vitals, we found her heart rate was over 200 beats per minute. He then escorted us straight back to a room where we were immediately met by Doctor Yee, and our primary nurse, Rachel. The OB department was notified and nurse Robin was sent down to monitor the baby while the rest of the awesome team took care of my wife. Everyone was so caring and kind throughout the entire experience. They gave my wife a medication that would briefly ""reset"" her heart. Before giving the medicine, Dr Yee, Jeff, and Rachel all explained thoroughly what was about to happen and exactly how she was going to feel. The medication worked like a charm and my wife's heart rate lowered to an normal rate. After the medicine, Rachel stayed with us to monitor my wife while Robin monitored the baby. Everything worked out great, and we were in and out in about 2 hours (mostly because they needed to monitor her after the medicine). I have no complaints about our experience at OCM and would definitely recommend them to anyone.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Viet made sure both my dad and mom were comfortable, and even offered to get breakfast for mom in the cafeteria while she waited during the test procedure.

Sheldon Devine,"How is it legal for these people to operate in business? I try never to go to the hospital, but I was in a pinch and decided I probably should get a hole inside my lip stitched up. Upon arrival, they quickly had me fill a couple of papers out, put a bracelet on my wrist and rushed me into the emergency room. I sat there for about 20 minutes, then a girl came by and said, your health insurance didn't work. So now I had a real issue. I asked her how much the treatment would cost if this was something I was going to have to pay myself. She said, well I can't tell you that, we don't know how much things cost. I told her I'll just leave then. She then went on to say, well no matter what you're gonna pay something because you're in here. This is without having received any treatment at all, just for them admitting me, which they should have checked my insurance before they did so. She said you may as well sign these papers and just take the treatment, you can work out the payment later. That being said, I figured ok, it can't be that much, all I need is a couple of stitches in my lip. BOY WAS I WRONG. So after signing the papers, a PA comes to see me and looks at my lip, she says she can't really do much because it's not that fresh, as I waited over night because I really didn't want to go to the hospital for obvious reasons. She sent a nurse over to clean out my lip, which he didn't do, he had me just do it myself. Then someone came by and gave me a tetanus shot. The PA decided she better give me at least 1 lose stitch, I'm guessing most likely so they could charge me more. So she gives me one lose stitch which didn't really do much and gives me a prescription and sends me on my way. Once I received the BILLS, and not just one BILL, but 2, one from the Hospital and one from the actual PA. They totaled $2500 for 1 lose stitch and a tetanus shot. Yes, $2500, I couldn't even believe that was real, but yes it is. So now due to my health insurance being messed up, because Health Net is the worst health insurance ever created, I'm stuck with this bill. The problem isn't everyone needs health insurance in this country, the problem is, health care is the most ridiculous costing thing in this country. I'm not sure how it's legal, but it is, and we all shouldn't stand for it. It's disgusting that places like this can get away with it.To all the people working here, you're not really helping people, you're just robbing them with a good conscious because maybe you helped them out a bit.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Christine Bernier is an amazing PA-C. She was very attentive and bubbly. I was admitted. Er nurse started a levaquin bag and left. It started infiltrating and kept calling/paging a nurse. No response so as an RN i stopped the pump. I had to wait til i was on the floor for pain control. My night nurse and aide were great and made up for the lack of caring in the er.

Jocelyn George,"I am writing my review as a ""visitor"" even though I wasn't ""visiting"" and was there to drop off some clean undies for a neighbor who ended up being admitted. Like I mentioned, my neighbor was admitted and I was asked from a relative to deliver some clean undies in a clear ziplock bag to the front desk in hopes a nurse would be able to deliver them to him.....boy was I wrong!!!!!When I entered the hospital, there were 3 men at the reception desk area involved in their own conversation. I was not asked if I needed assistance or if I had a question, instead I was glared at for interrupting them and apparently I was supposed to know that being stared at means the equivalent of ""can I help you"". I mentioned I wasn't visiting and there to drop off a care package for a patient who had been admitted. I was sent to ""Joe"" I believe who is the security next to the reception desk. Joe starting filling out a paper wrist visiting band and I said I wasn't visiting and there to just drop off a package. He gave me the rudest look and nastiest response of "" this ain't a courier service!"" and sent me back to the boys at the counter who again said no we don't take anything to anyone. Finally one of the men said he would take it and my husband slipped him a $5. He ran after us in the parking lot and said he couldn't take the money as this was his job. I asked him what happened and why the drama and disrespect to me inside. He stated that due to liability they cant take anything but because he could clearly see it was only underwear he took it. I told him that was all that needed to be stated to begin with inside, not the unprofessional smart ass remark I received. I am appalled and disgusted by the lack of sensitivity the front desk/security has with this hospital. For being such a sensitive nature facility (ie, a hospital!) the coldness and lack of any desire to even be there was non existent. Care, concern, and values should be top priority when dealing with visitors and patients and all I received was numb. I will be in contact with Human Resources to express my concern on all departments involved.

During my four day stay I was treated each day by someone even nicer and more knowledgeable than the last and they we're already WELL above average on day one! From the ER to the radiology lab to the blood work team and especially the medical wing I was consistently impressed. I can be squeamish at times and they were more than accommodating. The night staff was WONDERFULLY caring and let me sleep as much as possible. The cleaning staff and maintenance were unobtrusive and kind. The food was really quite decent and food staff made me feel appreciated and comfy with many choices and a pleasant demeanor.When I needed some lightheartedness to calm my nerves they all of them were kind and jovial and when it was time to talk serious stuff they were confident and understanding and very good at listening.I had contact with almost two dozen doctors, nurses, assistants and techs and I would give every one of them 5 stars based on their time with me.I had a lot of choices and I diligently picked Memorial based on family and friend recommendations and I believe I couldn't have made a better choice.Thank you Drs Harris and Hanna, nurses Sheri and Aris and Eme, and all the ER crew including Frank and all in radiology, everyone whose name I missed and especially my intake person who continued to ask about my progress.

Mind you, I understand that being a nurse isn't exactly an easy job, in fact it's very demanding. So I'm not just going to rant and rave about petty things. My mother has been to this hospital twice within the past month. I have to work so when I leave she relies on the nurses to help her. Instead they unplug her nurse call button and place it out of her reach. Then my mother is forced to sit in her soiled clothing for over 45min while my aunt is on the phone with her waiting the whole time. Then there was a new nurse that came in while I was here and when asked about my mother's insulin, she had no clue that my mother even had diabetes. Um hello??? Do you even read your charts???

Upon arrival (we had admission papers) we did not have to wait long to be admitted and get a room. Staff helped my dad get to his room and was friendly. Nurses were quick to arrive and make sure my dad was comfortable. Â Only problem was that RN say a potential bio hazard in the room but ignored it. 2/4 YelpsHousekeeping and upkeep: Extremely Â disappointed. Thier were several problems with the hospital room we got. Major: Broken razor blade left atop hand sanitizing canister. ( Using the and sanitizer I found it loosely attached so I but my hand atop it to stabilize it and I nearly sliced my hand open so Â I was really offended by this. Their is no telling where the razor blade has been. Granted it could have been used for supplies but I could have been used on a patient with some sort of infection also. Â  Soiled Phone: Trying to make my dad more comfortable I wanted to find the phone in the room so that he could use it if need be. Upon discovering it I was shocked. Atop the phone their is a substance that appears to be blood! God forbid someone uses it a any microbes on it is transferred to to a ill patient. Â  Mattress is soiled: Â  MinorPhone jack out of service. Summary. I truly enjoyed the staff they were knowledgeable, altruistic, and nice. But this does not make up for poor housekeeping. With nosocomial infections and MRSA such a threat to patient health I really hoped that a hospital would be more responsible with house keeping. I am really disappointed with the state of our room.

I wound up scheduling with Newhope Imaging because I called Memorial Care Imaging and the receptionist was very rude. She accused me of not reading her the MRI description as my doctor wrote. My doctor didn't write a lengthy description and I told her exactly what it said 3 times because she kept asking. The receptionist raised her voice at me and accused me of not reading what the doctor wrote. She also gave me a lot of hassle about how my mri order does not have a box selection for contract or without contrast. I have seen mri orders before and my other doctors gave me ones with a box checked. There was no option to check a box for contrast on this order. I told her that my doctor can fax her. She was being rude and said that it sounds like I am just telling her what I think and not what the paper says. This call took place on Monday, August 31st at 2:44 PM. I called Newhope Imaging after and they were very nice and are verifying my insurance and how much my copay will be first and they are calling my doctor.

Clarke Goldsmith,"Hard for a lay person to grade the technical ability of a medical provider. Most of the time, you just go by the result. In this case, I walked into the ER with a kidney stone problem. If you hadn't experienced this before, the pain can be excruciating. The need for relief is immediate. At five in the morning, following a Saturday night, I was lucky that the ER was relatively empty. They put me on a bed right away and I was immediately attended to by a slew of nurses and doctors. They tried different pain medications before nailing it to give me complete relief. In the meantime, they kept me warm, hydrated, and contacted my urologist. Anticipating a surgical procedure the next day, they added antibiotics to the IV and got me in for an x-ray and mri scan. The 'stone' was located and measured. By the time I was admitted to a semi private room, the ER was full. I spent the next 2 nights Â there while they controlled the pain until they were able to break up the stone via lipotropsy (the shockwave). There were no glitches and I was discharged pain-free on Tuesday. The hospital routine is always the same. You lay there in bed, either in pain or bored to death. Seems like they are waking you up every hour to take blood, your vitals, your meds. Your roommate, if you have one, seems like the person who either yells, complains or snores a lot. (Then again, Â maybe i was THAT GUY.). You try going to the restroom and it's no easy trick hauling your IV pole around with you. Â BUT The one Â thing that stands out this time? THE STAFF. Â No matter what else they had to do, they were without fail patient, helpful and good natured. Not unnecessarily cheerful but extraordinarily professional in the way they did their jobs and doing so as they were being Â besieged by their beepers. Of course that's Â part of their job, it's what they get paid to do but what other job involves 12-hour shifts (during the ""graveyard""), with a ward of unhappy/ailing customers, who are given your cell no and the permission to call you with any concern that comes to mind (""my IV is beeping"", ""can you get me sugar-free vanilla ice cream"", ""can I have a warm blanket"", ""can you empty my urinal container""). And those were just some of mine. Â Ok. So that's part of their job, along with the digital paperwork that they have to keep logging and lord only knows what else. I suspect that dealing with the patients is not always the most time consuming part but the most draining. To field multiple requests Â at the same time from different patients at different locations with the patient expectation that their particular request is the most important is a losing scenario. You can never meet that expectation. I expect that they often face criticisms for being too slow or the inevitable ""2d beep"" and ""where are you?"" call. OCMH seems to have 2 nurses and then other staff that just pitches in and helps at all times. I was very satisfied with their efforts and results. My needs were always met within a reasonable time. Don't know why someone like me (who is usually pretty clueless) noticed what I did this time but it was something that stood out from how they handled themselves.

One of the biggest deciding factors for us is the size of this hospital, it is a lot smaller than others and it makes for more personalized care and attention. What takes this place over the top is the incredible nursing staff. I especially would like to give recognition to my nurse Mirette, she honestly went above and beyond her call of duty. You know you have created a special bond with your nurse when you are saddened by knowing that you will miss her when you are discharged. I would also like to recognize nurse Sheila who is a breastfeeding guru. I did not get the name of all the other nurses but they were all AMAZING!! Thank you ladies for loving your careers and transmitting that love to your patients. To top things off the lactation specialist Lori was wonderful and very well informed. We love the Center for Childbirth at OCMMC! P.S. The food service people are extremely friendly and all of my meals were great.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Kim Richmond,This review is only for the ER Doctor that was supposed to assist me. Â The rest of the staff was very professional and kind. Â I went in because I was extremely dizzy and having chest pain. Â Before the Doctor even saw me he sent in a Nurse to give me meds for anxiety because he said I was having an anxiety attack??? I refused to take the meds because I was told they would make me sleepy... how was I supposed to tell the Doctor what was going on or ask questions if I was sleepy???? Once the Doctor was told I refused the meds he decided to discharge me without doing anything... not even a CBC!!! Â I left in tears and in worse shape than when I went in. Â The only thing I got out of this visit was a very large co-payment bill.,1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Ada Mcdonald,My Mother had surgery here on Monday March 19 2018 overall her stay was good all the staff and nurses etc were very friendly and helpful.Hospital was very clean and they have free valet parking til 7pm.... when we got to the pre op waiting room there was an employee that gives u a card with a # on it to track the progress of the surgery on a big monitor with checkmarks to know if your loved one is in pre op then surgery then post op then to a room and can receive visitors..they also have wifi and hot spot and charging stations and complimentary fruit infused water...the nurses will also call the pre op waiting room and let you know when you can come back the only problem with this was that after 1 pm there was no longer an employee to answer said phone and after several un answered phone calls and everyone wondering about patient updates I started answering the phone! getting around the hospital was like a maze! we had to go up one elevator then down another elevator through long hallways to first get to pre op room! after a little exploring we found a much easier and shorter route to get where we needed...right next to the pre op waiting room is a small cafeteria i had read the reviews and everyone said cafeteria was great NOT !! It was small food looked all dry and gross there was only like 3 hot food options which they serve for breakfast and lunch no variety they have a small salad bar and prepackaged sandwiches NOT IMPRESSED!!

Renee Hussain,"In feb. I had an amazing experience at this hospital, I wish right now I could write a review about that great experience, but after the stay i just had i am sickened by the quality of care of that i received from basically two specific providers that I cannot. Â I went to the ER with a complex that was 7 cm large (avg size of an ovary itself is 3-5 cm) in terrible pain, and they admitted me to the hospital. Â Everyone was kind, they did not give me any food because i think that they were assuming that i would have surgery to remove this extremely large cyst. Dr. Charles Moniak decided not to (which was not the problem or even the reason i'm writing this review, even though i am currently still in terrible pain, have to go back to work tomorrow with this 7 cm cyst, and nothing was resolved after spending two nights in the hospital). Â I am writing because he sent me for an ultra sound so he thought that i wasn't in my room and I heard him yell to a nurse ""GREAT, why do i always get the chronic pain patients?.."" He asked him how often I was asking for my pain medication like I was there seeking drugs, and didn't even bother to see me before the ultra sound so the tech was looking for my gall bladder which was removed almost 10 years ago. Â Then when I saw him (which was only for around 5 minutes just so he could tell me that he wasn't going to do it he was very rude). Â I'm 27 years old and i have been struggling since I was 12 years with both endometriosis and PCOS. Â I understand not wanting to deal with me because i am a complicated case, but to yell something like that in the hallway of your work place is COMPLETELY and utterly inappropriate Â The only thing that I can say that was good about this experience was that the pain management doctor was very efficient and checked back on me at least three times. Â I only saw the OB once, and i only saw Dr. Lala-Reddy when they were going to release me. They also said that they were going to monitor it for the next 6-12 weeks, and i'm not really sure how because I have had Dr. Lala- Reddy as my primary care physician since my original surgery and she hasn't checked back on me once about anything.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Mica Lindsey,"READ THIS CAREFULLY before you decide to send your loved ones here. My father had some issues with his stomach, couldn't eat, sleep for at least 2, 3 weeks. Â He was so weak to a point we had to send him to Orange Coast ER room for the first time. They asked him couple questions, then sent him home with some stomache medications (!). About a week later, Â he felt worse, so we sent him back. All they told us was: ""you brought him back on time, thank you"". They kept him there for 3 days, gave him some blood tests, and ran IV. Then they transferred him to West Anaheim Medical because ""he's a little stable now so we will send him there because it is closer to your home"". West Anaheim detected him with severe Hepatitis, and referred him to USC for possible liver transplant. And a month later, we received a bill for 10k dollars for 3 days stay, with no operations, no private room, no sense of urgency from the staffs, waste of time, and almost cost his life.

Aria Lozano,"I went to the ER with severe pain in my chest. The nurses and doctors talked to me condescendingly and the doctor didnt even introduce himself and became angry when I didnt understand what he was saying because of his speech. He said I had pleurisy and tried to send me home with norcos so I refused the medication with nothing. Pleurisy can be an indication of a blood clot in your lungs and many other life threatening illnesses. They did not test me for anything, later an urgent care doctor confirmed that they should have tested me for anything life threatening.

I'm already having a bad day, do you need to make it worse? If you can make it through the gatekeepers you'll love the nurses and the doctors behind the curtain. The doctor quickly came by to shake my hand, introduce himself and told me to make myself comfortable. The process went pretty quickly. The nurse was an adorable man that did everything right. Joked and told me stories to help calm my nerves. He got my iv vein on the first try. Checked on me every 10 minutes. I honestly couldn't have asked for better service.

This time around, my L&amp;D nurses Joann and Ann were utterly sweet, knowledgable and just overall very attentive. My labor was progressing very quickly, and I found myself much more nervous this time around. Joann took her time in helping me ease my fears and fully explained everything that was going on. My recovery nurses Dianne, Char and Shelly were all wonderful and sweet as well. Although I'm an RN myself, they never took any shortcuts in explaining what they were doing. I noticed that they strictly followed protocol such as performing hand hygiene before and after patient care, cleaning their stethoscopes before listening to my baby, and they each scanned my wristband every time medication was administered. As a prior nursing student, I've witnessed my fair share of nurses taking ""shortcuts"" before, but none were taken here.

I expected worse and was extremely concerned and had anxiety. The staff that attended me was the best. I had many nurses bcuz I was in for 3 days. All were consistent on service and information. They walked me thru it all and that helps SO MUCH. As for Dr Conner, she worked hand in hand with the nurses and checked up on me at the hospital to see my progress. She was totally up front with me and suggested the epidural due to my narrow pelvic. I took her advice bcuz duhhh...she's the educated doctor! I took the epidural and a few hrs later I had a natural birth. I was told another Dr would be delivering my child. I had no problem with it bcuz I mean hello, at that point I couldn't choose. But Dr Conner, she stayed PAST HER SHIFT just to deliver my baby. That made my just love her even more. AMAZING WOMAN I TELL YOU! The staff as well. I couldn't have chosen a better hospital.

Anwar Vasquez,"Prior from my dad's surgery I heard from a previous patient ""this hospital is no good, they always keep you in longer than you need to""So I had already had a bad taste with this hospital My family had a horrible experience with Orange Coast Memorial hospital . My father went in for Low invasive robotic heart surgery 3 weeks ago and passed away 11/25. I felt like it was necessary to write a yelp review for anyone considering to go/ or send a family member or loved one to this hospital for robotic heart surgery.My dad's surgery: The complication started during anesthesia, the anesthesiologist made a mistake and punctured my dad's lung /coronary sinus Â - Â this caused too much damage to his system to continue with original procedure Â so then they had to go forward with Â open heart surgery and open up the chest .The doctors Â didn't realize my dad had internal bleeding in his lung until they completed the heart surgery and closed him up. My dad went into shock but they didn't know why . They had to reopen my dad's chest and drain the blood in his lung.The internal bleeding was caused by the puncture- they Closed my dad's chest again and then my dad went into shock for the 2nd time . His heart, lungs, had been damaged causing his system to fail including kidneys . The doctors then put my dad on life support having him on 5 drips to support his blood pressure , balloon pump for his heart(tubes coming directly from his open chest) ventilator for his lungs so that he can breath . His kidneys failed completely . We were shocked and our entire family was greiving seeing my dad suffer in pain on life support and knowing that the doctors ""messed up"" on him. Over a course of 3 weeks my dad was in ICU- each day there was progress so we had hope . The nurses were sweet and attentive to my dad (except crystal who dreaded our visits on her late shift) Â my dad had to get dialysis treatment because his kidneys stopped working . He was unable to eat because he had an infection in his mouth from all the antibiotics. He lost strength and could not get up. He passed away 2 days ago . My dad came in to fix a valve in his heart and now he had damaged lung and kidneys? It didn't make sense to me. Even though I am glad the suffering for my dad is over - I am very disappointed in all the mistakes the doctors did that costed my dad his life. We all know going into any surgery is risky - but I feel like for my dad's particular case he was not in the best hands and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone .",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Ronnie Fitzpatrick,"Where do I start? For the most part the nurses have an idea of what they're doing but they're pretty careless. I won't make that statement unless I had concrete evidence. I have a sister who's a nurse anesthetist who was with my dad in the ICU and now telemetry. My dad had a stroke. First, the admitting worker simply couldn't read the insurance card. An RN in the emergency room comes to the family and states that we must provide cash or a check in order for him to receive treatment. WTF!!?? SERIOUSLY!!?? Some professionalism that was. In this era an inmate receives medical treatment faster than a good citizen? Not only that, on the way to an MRI the tech took my dad around the hospital looking for the MRI room on top of that this idiot tech made him get up and walk to the MRI after a stroke. Coming back to the emergency room, no one was notified and my brother had to go let the nurse know that he was back in the emergency room. Waited in the ER for 14 hours before being admitted to ICU. No professionalism was shown towards us in that unit until they found out I was a police officer, my sister a nurse anesthetist, and my brother a respiratory therapist. At first they treated like we were little kids and didn't know what we were talking about. Yet my sister has more schooling and knowledge than those nurses in the whole unit. The neurologist Dr. PARK comes in and checks on my dad, does a little range of motion exercise and walks out, said something everything's resolved. WTF is resolved? He had a stroke for crying out loud. An internal medicine by the name of Doctor CHIDAO NGUYEN later in the day comes in and does exactly the same thing. Asks some obvious questions and walks out. I asked dumbass Dr Nguyen what was the result of the echocardigram he said he'll check and ends up leaving the unit without saying anything to the family. We had to have a nurse call him on the phone so one of us could speak to him. Another great sign of professionalism. Transfers up to the telemetry floor, nurses again Dr Dumbass Nguyen comes and does the same thing. Shift changes. Nurses were going to give my dad some medication, sister questions it, nurse can't justify and said they're following the doctor's orders. Some new medications were on order to be given last night to my dad yet they were not part of the discharge orders. How does a doctor order new meds for a patient one day and send him home with completely different meds to be taken everyday? So we're waiting in the room to speak to a doctor regarding discharge, my sister notice a first degree heart block on the heart monitor. The telemetry nurse completely disagrees and begins arguing with my knowledgeable sister stating that it was sinus rhythm. My sister requested a printout of the reading and the nurse brought it to her and realizes that she was wrong and agrees with my sister. Tries to get the dumbass DR careless CHIDAO Nguyen on the phone, doctor yells at the RN and says he doesn't want to care to talk to anyone on the phone and for us to wait for him to get to the hospital to talk. So the wait starts, about 30 mins later, the RN in charged of my dad for the day comes in and states that there has been an error with the insurance. Asks us if anyone has come in to notify us of the situation. We're completely blindsided and asked what situation? That dr dumbass Nguyen was never suppose to see my dad. All his orders has be disregarded and can't be followed. As we sit here on the telemetry floor waiting for the case manager to come and speak to us, we're completely in utter shocked of the professionalism this hospital along with its staff has shown. Sense my complete sarcasm? The RN states that she will try to get a hold of the case manager hoping that this individual has not gone home. I'm in complete frustration. As the rest of this day plays out, I can't see things getting any better. If I can give this place a negative star rating or even a zero rating definitely count on it.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Â Caring, warm, tender with my sweet dad, Â I found them attentive and communicative and responsive to my dad's needs. Â In general, I hold nurses in esteem somewhere around saints and angels on earth. Â These mentioned above were no disappointment. Â He is a gentle man and deserves this. Â That being said ...ATTENTION NURSING SUPERVISORS:Unfortunately, my dad's second day post-op he had ICU RN Kristen on 2-5-14. Â At the outset I found her cool and aloof, but I wasn't concerned with that at that moment. (Just take care of my dad!) Â It's hard to put this in words, but she seemed distant and observing as if she were in a school lab or something. Â  She then began removing tapes from my dad's body and was oddly standing ramrod straight and just watching him react in pain, as if it were a science experiment or something. Maybe she didn't know what to do here. Â  She removed a tube from my dad's neck, and we thought my dad would pass out from pain and yelling. Â This was his worst moment the whole hospital stay. Â  She just stood there looking at him. Â  There were terrible marks and bruises and assaults on his neck skin which I took pictures of. Â She was only mildly observing my dad instead of speaking to him to calm him or reassuring him this would be over soon or some comforting words ... NOT forthcoming from this nurse! Â She brought orange juice to my dad when requested but made it clear she was not happy about it. Â She did have plenty of time for high-energy eye contact and plenty of flirtation with my married brother. Â I am sure she works hard for her looks so she can wear the tight scrubs, but this is not the environment for that. Â Her behavior was inappropriate and not the professional level we found everywhere else in the hospital. Â I would chalk that part up harmlessly to her personality but for the weirdly cold, unfeeling, and seemingly out-of-body and only borderline competent care for my dear father. Â Should this unprofessional girl be in ICU?",3,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Jan Allison,My family loves this hospital. They have excellent care and amazing staff working together. I recommend this hospital to everyone. I had my daughter here 9 yrs ago and I have had other surgeries here. My dad had to have a pace make replaced from what another dr did wrong in Texas and they fixed him here.

Mae Stacey,We had great experience until my mother was moved to room one of the worst I have ever seen in my life to the point that I start it expecting her to be on some kind of drugs she use very bad obscenities she was very rude and she also at 09:50pm came to the room to give my mother antibiotic and the she was ripping things that made her bleed and when I point it out to her she answered me in such a way like how dare I asked and she said that the blood was there already and then I showed her that blood was dripping from her hand so she start it ripping the tape needle and mad it even worst. Very bad but I'll wait to hear from someone as we usually receive great service here and never had to deal with such a bad experience but I will not stay quite about this please contact me if you have any question,1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Dominique Kearns,"I delivered my baby here, and the nurses were all so kind and helpful. I had been dreading my hospital stay leading up to it, but once I was there, it was really nice.

By the end of my stay, I found myself realizing I would miss having all of the help, but confidant in myself from all of the info I received.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Jude Cobb,DO NOT GO THERE! This place scares me to death. I'm sure my father would have died if I hadn't been there and if we hadn't left. I found the nurses asleep at night. You could hear one of them snore. Most of the Asian nurses told me they didn't speak English when we asked for help. I talked to them and they would just stare at me blankly. Dad sat in soiled diapers for hours. I had to change him and he was so embarrassed. They never bathed him even though we kept asking. No water. His pain was out of control and they refused to call the doctor. The call lights rang forever. It makes me sick thinking about it. Dad says it's the worst place he has ever been. We will be filing a complaint with JCAHO. How are they accredited at all? Other families told me the same thing. God help us if we ever have to go there again. I wanted so bad to call the news station and let everyone know. I hope this helps you not go through what we did.,1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Amal Wicks,"this hospital truly cares for the patients! i only give it less than 5 stars due to the fact that it took over 20 ER 911 calls until they realised that i had a severe GI problem, and i kept getting kicked loose at first with them calling it food poisioning or stomach flu! how many times in a week can you have the stomach flu? well, now that the dr finally figured out it was a rare condition known as cyclic vomiting syndrome as well as gastroparesis, i was finally taken seriously! i must say, the nurses would see me coming in by ambulance over and over, and i'd have them running to my aid to help! it was just common misdiagnoses with my condition that caused the delay in admissions. once they realized i was extremely ill, they gave me excellent care, brought in the best doctors, i was on medi-cal and i still got top doctors! this hospital has everything! most of my doctor specialists are at this hospital. sadly, i don't live in the area, but i almost went back there the other day due to the lack of proper care i have received in LA County! i still remember Sandy yelling""dakota!"" one of my many nicknames, as well as the miracle child, bionic woman, love child, etc. they truly get to know and care for you! best drs in so. california!",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Kymani Read,"This is a review on Labor &amp; Delivery! Â I had an amazing birthing experience at this hospital and I am so glad I decided on having my son here instead of at Hoag. Â Everyone took such great care of me and made me feel like I was a family member that they were taking care of. Â Joanne Â and Leah were my nurses and I couldn't have asked for anyone better. Â Joanne was there for me while I was admitted and had a million questions and fears. Â She never got annoyed and answered all my questions and made me feel totally comfortable. Â When I found out she was going home at 7pm and my new nurse Leah was coming, I got really anxious. Â But Leah was amazing too, like an old (but young) friend. Â She totally put me at ease and worked with me to get my baby in the right position so that I could have a vaginal birth. Â She seemed genuinely happy for me that I got to have the birthing experience I wanted. Â She knew how scared I was to get a catheter in recovery so she even came over to do it (even though that wasn't her department), just to make me comfortable. Â And it didn't even hurt. Â She brought her bubbly nurse Allie with her which was also amazing and the 2 of them had me cracking up! Â Dr. Lena delivered my baby and everything went perfect there too. Â In recovery, Yoli and Kim took great care of me. Â Mama Charlie even recommended letting the nursery nurse watch my son so we could get some much needed sleep and Tess and Kim did that for us. Â We were so grateful. I actually cried when I left the hospital because everyone took such great care of me and I was just so grateful. Â Thank you all for taking such good care of me :)",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Jayden Joyce,"My fiance had a cardiac ablation here a few weeks ago. While I can say the nurses in the Cath Lab &amp; ICU were amazing &amp; respectful, the nurses on floor 1 were inappropriate &amp; perverted. Upon moving him to a regular bed, he began to bleed from cath site in groin area. They exposed his genitals for 25 min and 3 diff nurses during this time touched, moved his genitals around with no explanation or intro to who they were. There was 7-9 nurses standing at foot of the bed staring at his genitals the entire time, including the visitors for pt next store, due to curtain was never closed. After he was bandaged and covered, the crowd began to leave. Then random nurses came in and lifted blanket to look. When the 3rd nurse walked up to lift blanket, I covered his genital area over blanket and yelled, ""No! The nurse just checked him and she's not even out the door yet! No!"" The nurse disregarded what I said, continued to lift blanket and said, ""I want to see"" with a big smile. We are in shock, hurt and angry. We have complained to the CEO, director and a few others there. Nothing has been done. Patient modesty &amp; sexual misconduct is something this hospital is not aware of.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Willie Goulding,"Out of all the ICU's, ERs, hospitals, etc. in Orange County (Kaiser facilities, Hoag, UCI...) Orange Coast Memorial has the best nurses/RNs/docs...I've been here every day for the past week- my mom had open heart surgery and is recovering very well- thanks to the caring workers. The doctors really took their time with her to explain every little detail. They were very informative, supportive, and caring. A few nurses that weren't on duty or working in a different area noticed my mom's name on the schedule and took the time to say hello to her and made sure she was doing okay. This made me so happy to see she was in good hands. They really strive to build a relationship with their patients... they don't just do their job because they HAVE to.This was the most nerve-wracking moment of my family's life. I'm forever grateful for the team who helped my mom- from the first day she entered the ER, to the surgeons, to ICU (RN: Mike I. is awesome!), to telemetry (all the nurses rock!)... my mom's life was literally in their hands and they saved her from the dangers that could have happened.

Elliott Oneill,"This review is strictly for L&amp;D (labor and delivery). I have had all 3 of my kids (2002, 2004, and 2010) there and would not go anywhere else. It was a great experience each and every time. The nurse with the curly hair is awesome!!Staff was very attentive and helpful with everything that I needed. 2 out of 3 times I had a room to myself which was awesome because hubby could stay and help with the baby. When I did have to share a room the staff was great about trying to keep both sides pretty private (well as much as you can with just a curtain separating you!!)Food was OK. Breakfast was the worst meal of the day but lunch and dinner options were fairly decent. All in all it was a really good experience delivering here. The only thing I really did not like was the shower because the water pressure was AWFUL. After giving birth all I wanted was to take a nice shower and it's hard to enjoy with just a dribble of water to wash your hair. Would recommend to any pregnant friend for L&amp;D!",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Â Also, my hospital room was pristine, spacious and quiet at night. Â That's definitely a first!! Â Bye bye Hoag and Hello Orange Coast!!

Landon Witt,"I've been admitted to the telemetry unit here four times now. Â Until lately the staff was very friendly and helpful, and many still are, but they are now hiring for ethnic language skills instead of nursing skills and things are going downhill. Â Its the luck of the draw. Â The noise level at all times of day and night is huge - overwhelming. Â Visitors are allowed to stay all night (more than one in a room) even when the room is shared with another patient. Â I felt like a zoo inmate as this man kept walking by me and staring at me (I ain't no man). Â My frustration level with the sleep deprivation is so great that I will not go back there. Â Do not expect the telemetry unit to have any ""quiet time"" except maybe between 1:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.UPDATE - A FEW WEEKS LATER. Â 3/18/14Well, since I posted that review i have been incarcerated in the telemetry unit two more times and there has been considerable improvement. Â The halls are quiet most of the night AND day.

Rhian Hanson,"I applied for a job here back in Sept. I called back in early Nov to follow up on my application. I got a call back from a recruiter wanting me to come over for an interview. It was scheduled the weds the week before Thanksgiving. I called back the week after Thanksgiving to follow up on my interview. I called HR, a lady who rudely told me to call the recruiter. I called the recruiter and he told me to call HR. I was being tossed around like a hacky sack. Before this happened, I left numerous voicemails to both the HR &amp; the recruiter. No callbacks. They only one that helped me was the receptionist. Very nice lady. I called back this morning and was told to call back at 3pm. So when I call, the rude lady in HR tells me that the job I applied for has been given to someone else ""more qualified"". Ok I get that. Why did I not get a call back of them telling me that in the first place. According to career-advice on monster.com, ""As for a company that never follows up with you after an interview-- even to say ""no thank you""-- that could be a sign that something is wrong with the company.

Even when I called a nurse to help me learn how to burp my baby at 3am, the nurse on duty was an absolute doll! The lactation nurse offered me her cell phone number and instructed me to call her even though she would be on vacation. It's not just the nurses and staff in recovery, either.

Until now....Apparently I'm a good patient who recovers quickly and a wimp who can't handle pain all at the same time. I'm a complex girl.When somone gives you a clicker that pumps morphine into your IV, use it....don't try to be a hero.So my three day stay at Orange Coast Memorial was a big success and I'm really glad it's over and I'm all better. Â It's a small facility in comparison to other hospitals. Â The well manicured grounds, and hospital rooms with sliding glass doors and balconies give it the feel of a hotel more than a hospital.The OR room was cold and sterile as it should be.

Â As far as I can tell, I don't have any instruments floating around inside me so I guess I'm good.The nurses and staff that took care of me were great.

You are brave souls indeed.The respiratory therapist guy who visited my room daily was a riot and kept making me laugh while I had that vapor filed mask on. Then he left his card in case I needed to contact him with questions ""of a respiratory nature"". Â Not sure what he meant by that, but no one else left me their business card. I can't review the hospital food, I was on a liquid diet. I heard their cafeteria was pretty good though. Â Minus one star for the poor design on their televisions.

I am absolutely cranky and totally a bitch when I am in pain. The nurses were attentive and very kind. Whenever my morphine drip could not provide me with instant relief, at the press of a button, a nurse comes in and soothes my pain with other methods of pain management. The bed was uncomfortable but I wasn't expecting much from a hospital bed. I was in pain, I'm guessing even if the bed was plush and absolutely comfortable on normal occasions, I would have still not liked it when I am in as much pain as I was.For the fact that they catered to my whim and patiently handled me when I am cranky and about to throw up and still smiled at me at the end of the day, I give this fine establishment a 5 star.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

I thought the wait was going to be extreme like it was at Kaiser I waited over 6 hours to be seen and all they did was do bloodwork, an ultrasound and give me a diet to follow plus adviced Zantac OTC and later received a $1,200 bill. Here I waited about 2 hours or less. Everyone from the admitting desk to the nurse and doctors were nothing but exceptional!! From the first nurse that helped me to a room and was concerned that I was in pain so she did what she had to do to get me my pain meds to the 3 different doctors I got to meet during the shift changes which by the way they didnt give up on finding out what was wrong with me they ran every test they had to.

I've asked multiple times to be called if anything had changed with her health and I had to call them several times just to get the news..and now before I wrote this review I got told to call back in 20 minutes once her nurse logs onto her phone. It really is just troubling I shouldn't have to hunt people down to get a straight answer ! ... clean hospital though.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

STAY AWAY!!!!I was wrongly billing for 2 stress tests and they failed to correct it even though my insurance and my OB office has provided them with all the necessary information.Yet, they decided to send me to a collection agency in less than the legal time to collect.On top, they created another issue regarding a breast pump, which I did not authorized.All the information it needs was provided to them and yet no response.I am not the type to waste my time on bad reviews but for this I have formally complained because they have incompetent billing staff and they wasted sooooo much of my time to fix this.Again, STAY AWAY from this hospital!!!",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

However I decided to give OCM a try, and I'm glad I did! Patient care here is excellent, all the nurses in L&amp;D as well as the Postpartum nurses were full of information.

This ER was empty,clean, the help was great, and they took me in to see a doctor within 5 min after filling out this little form. I saw Melissa who was a very nice doctor who spoke to me very kindly and very informative of the procedure she was going to do. It was easier than I imagined the procedure was going to be like and she was done within 5 or so min of starting :-)Thank you Melissa for helping me out and being so nice The only bummer part was when I was waiting for my Discharge papers, it took me an hour to get out of the room and that was because one of the lady's forgot to tell me after giving me some paperwork I had to sign off for that it was the discharge paperwork I was waiting for and that I could not leave because she told me to wait there til I had goten my discharge papers. I was just happy to have been taken care of and everyone of the staff there were very nice.i recommend this ER",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Renee Cohen,"If you don't have any other choice, otherwise do your research and find a more competent group of health care professionals.My mother-in-law had her gallbladder removed based on the fact that he said she had multiple stones in her gallbladder. Â Dissection of her gallbladder afterwards found no gallstones. This surgeon had provided us with misinformation in order to fulfill his contractual duties. We called the hospital to complain. They said to speak with the surgeon himself because he is not their doctor, he is just contracted to use their facility.Perhaps the hospital should be more selective in signing out their contracts to safeguard against issues with the Department of Public Health and the Medical Board.We confronted the surgeon and asked him some very candid question but he could not provide any straight forward answers. Â Apparently the referring MD and the surgeon failed to review the final test result the night before the surgery which indicated that the absence of stones.

Â Tests done, some guy that worked handed me a pic showing I had esophagitis, inflamed esophagus and ulcers. Â Took the dr. 8 hrs to come to my room. The when doctor did come said I told you during the procedure, I was totaling under how could I remember. Asked when I could go home he said any time. Â Mind you I couldn't eat or drink anything without pain. So I said, what home to die as I was surviving off IV. Â The whole time I was there could never find a nurse.

Jerry Gonzales,I was a patient at Long Beach Memorial for lung surgery and Â was surprised at how wonderful all the staff were. I can see why they are a magnet hospital. The R.N.'s there are top notch. Then I came home and ended up with air trapped in my lung and ended up in E.R. At Orange Coast Memorial. Though their E.R. Was so busy they got me to radiology in record time for them to put in a chest tube. The radiology dept. was fabulos and within a half hour my tube was in.

Denny Mcculloch,"This hospital is the absolute worst. My wife had to have surgery here. When we got there, they wanted cash to pay the anesthesiologist. No one bothered to tell us about his in advance. The amount of money they asked for was more than I had on me and more than the daily limit that my bank allowed for ATMs.I had to call the bank and request an increase in my daily limit while time ticked away. Then I went back to the hospital's generic cash machine,which still wouldn't give me what I needed. So I had to get in the car and try to find the nearest Wells Fargo branch that had a cash machine. It was early and the bank was closed.I got the money, drove back to the hospital, and paid them. This might be a good point to mention that the only place to park the car was a lot that was about two blocks from the hospital. There's one closer, but it's always full.After the surgery, my wife was still about 3/4 under the anesthetic, but they put her in a wheelchair and released her. She told them that she felt nauseous and asked to stay longer, but they said they couldn't let her stay because she needed the room.Next, I had to drive home to Irvine at about 30 miles an hour because any faster and my wife was going to throw up in the car. I practically had to carry her up the stairs to our house because she was still under the influence of anesthesia and was barely conscious.There's more that I can't go into, but if your doctor says you need a procedure at this hospital, DON'T DO IT!!!!

Coming in for surgery, a person is already feeling nervous, I feel that there needs to be a more welcoming person to ease these feelings at first point of contact. It may be a bad day for her, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt. My moms day nurses; Helene, Taylor and Amelia were so great and made my mom feel so comfortable. We need more staff like this working in our hospitals. It makes a huge difference in Customer service and the way a person is made to feel during difficult times.

Dr.Moore (her office is located @ the OrangeCoast Memorial Medical Center....the building in front of the hospital) Â i started going to her and she was not happy with my cyst although i was TOLD previously...that it could shrink... it was growing disturbingly large and making me ache like none othershe sent me to get 3d ultrasounds, had me get ca-125 tested for ovarian cancer and worked quickly to get me back to ""normal""eventually BECAUSE the previous idiot took so long to take any action(it became 16cm) i had to forego laparoscopy (using small incisions and cameras) and had to go for the full on surgery ( think caesarian) i was scared SHITLESS i mean seriously i sleep like a baby every nite and have the thickest hair but once i knew i was heading towards surgery i stayed up for days and my hair was falling out in clumps...i was terrifiedday of surgery i walked right into the waiting room of the hospital. Â (the previous day i did all my presurgery junk &amp; a bloodtest so i could just walk-in the day of)i got changed and i was told to lay on the bed with heat pads all around me to keep me warm while i answered a series of very annoying repetitive questions.... i was SERIOUSLY scared of the IV but the doctor who inserted it did it perfectly and i felt no discomfort...soon after that i got to say byebye to the parents and off i was pushed into the operating room which i dont even KNOW because i blissfully knocked out before theni then awoke SCREAMING PROFANITIES at the top of my lungs i swear i was in some severe pain thats when the nurse next to me instructed i"" push push push the morphine"" and soon i was highhh like a kitesoon after i was rolled into my room and from then on the nurses did the best to take care of me...nights were HORRIBLE because i could hear heartmonitors and people screaming in pain but the nurses were there to keep me okay.

Mylie Thatcher,"Im writing this under my boyfriends account the experience we both had here at this hospital. First off I would like to say the hospital is amazing but the anesthesiologist dr truong who gave me two epidural had a very bad attitude towards me and I was in so much pain I still was thankful and calm towards her. The first epidural hit only for two hours and wore off and even though I clicked the button for more MEDS and it did not work and gave me bad contractions. I kept advising her it didn't work anymore and while she was doing the epidural she would make comments that I was a little big and short and it was hard for her to work with me. Honestly I was in soo much pain I just wanted the pain to go away. The second time she removed the epidural and did it over. Once she stuck the needle again in and Out trying to find the right spot she would make sounds like she was frustrated. And STILL REMIND YOU I WAS CALM AND THANKFUL TO HER. But this time when she shot the meds in my back it hit my neck and the upper part of my back like a sore feeling that make me say ouch and she responded everything I do to you, you complain that's why I'm scared to work with you. Can anyone tell me who the hell says that to someone like your the fucking professional and your telling me I complain well hello im in pain and again let me tell you epidural only hit for two hours again and I felt all my contractions after that. When my doctor decided to do a c section after 30 hours. Another anesthesiologist I ADVISED THE EPIDURAL DID NOT WORK ANYMORE FOR ME. So she removed it and did it over. Im sorry it did not numb me and the worst part they did a c section when I was not numb. I begged my dr to help and my boyfriend was worried he saw that I was not okay the anesthesiologist had to put me to sleep. This is the first birth I gave and I can say I am traumatized. The second anesthesiologist actually visited me in the recovery side and explained what had happened. Apparently who ever stuck the epidural before on me ( dr truong) went past the epidural place or whatever spot your supposed to poke. OKAY but honestly im over it I felt pain I have never thought would happened and never wish this on anyone. Â  Â  ----------------Why im giving this a four star because the nurses on the recovery side was the sweetest to me. Everyone heard how bad my labor was and they were so helpful to me especially Merritt, Karen, and Lisa they are the best nurses ever they made me enjoy my stay and took soo good care of me I cannot thank them enough for all there tlc they showed me. They honestly need an award or a raise because my boyfriend and I truly are thankful for them they even made my nightmare labor turn into just a relaxing break that I needed. And also NICU Mrs. Joyce and Donna took really good care of my daughter while she was in there and giving us tips on parenting and im so happy with them. I can say if I ever now decide to have another baby and giving birth I would just make sure I have a professional anesthesiologist work with me who is caring and loving not a rude unhappy basically looks like she did not like her job type of female. Other than that I really like the food here and it is a really nice hospital. Hope I didn't scare people as much because I am traumatized but then I look at my daughter and I can't be more happier than ever to have her healthy and beautiful",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

I had heard many people say this before, but until I had to go there I didn't really get it!!!The emergency waiting room was full and people waited for hours.

Leigh Howarth,"This afternoon an ambulance took my 90 year old mother to the ER at Orange Coast Memorial Hospital and I arrived about 15 minutes behind her. Â I went to the ER and asked about her and was told to wait a few minutes. Â Half an hour later I went back to the desk and told them I wanted to see my mother. Â She has dementia, is easily confused, gets paranoid and worried, and I knew she wanted me to be there with her. Â Also, I was unclear as to what was wrong with her and, if it was serious, I didn't want her to be alone if she was dying. Â They gave me no information on her condition and told me I had to continue waiting. Â Then they informed me that she hadn't even been taken to a bed and was still on a gurney in the hallway. Â For some reason they seemed to think it was unreasonable to have me wait with her. Â They got mad at me when I asked if they were refusing to allow me to see her. Â It got very frustrating because they wouldn't take me to her but they kept saying they weren't refusing to let me see her. Â I said I would call the police if necessary and that is when they decided to call security on me. Â Then they informed me that she was in ""ultrasound"" and that there are no visitors allowed there anyway. Â I am pretty sure she wasn't in ultrasound. Â I left before security came because I knew it would just be some guy with an authority complex who was going to tell me to sit down and shut up. Â After he returned home from work, my husband went over to the hospital to find out what was going on with my mother. Â He said she was upset, confused, worried, and paranoid and everything one would expect from a woman who was left along without her family. Â My husband had to insist that staff help her to the bathroom as she wanted to pee. Â The staff told him originally that she could just pee in her adult underwear. Â He found this undignified and insisted that they help him to the bathroom. Â I am surprised they didn't call security on him. Â I don't know what level of care this hospital thinks it is providing but the front office staff in the ER were rude, abrupt, and lacking in empathy. Â How much kinder and simpler it would have been if they had just let me go sit with her while she waited to see a doctor. Â I tried to get her out of there but her insurance plan won't approve another hospital. Â Now my goal is to make sure she never goes back there.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Amritpal Peralta,"My mother is currently admitted due to cardiac issues. The admitting physician appears to have the core physical issues under control. However, my mother has issues with depression and anxiety, and she has been crying intermittently, because she is so weak, that she can barely rearrange herself in her bed. She needs a sitter to be with her continuously, and she needs her antidepressant medication, which apparently wasn't communicated to the ER physicians when she was brought to the hospital by EMT personnel. Last night, I watched my mother repeatedly in a spiral of crying, breathlessness, despair, while the nurse tells me that she cannot get a doctor to call back and prescribe an antidepressant -- and, that no sitter is available, because they don't have sufficient staff to cover patients other than those who are combative. So, I end up HIRING someone to sit with my mom, because like most people, I have to work in the daytime, and I cannot be sitting with mom 24/7. This is outrageous, in my opinion. Hospitals typically charge up to $5,000 per day or more for care, and I'm forced to shell out $25 per hour to hire a private caregiver to keep my mother reasonably comfortable. Moreover, the day before this occurred, a hospital nurse called me and asked me to bring one of my mother's prescriptions to the hospital because THE HOSPITAL DIDN'T HAVE THE MEDICATION IN ITS PHARMACY! I have a fair amount of recent experience as a hospital patient, in several different facilities. My care was magnitudes better than what I'm observing at Orange Coast Memorial. Maybe this is the status quo of medical care for the average person, and I was just more fortunate with the care that I received while hospitalized. The health care system is broken. And, it's not Obama's fault. The system is overwhelmed and understaffed, and there's no effective means of making a timely complaint, because the physicians are in control, and everyone else involved must simply wait on their authority and availability.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Dion Nash,"The only reason I have created an account on Yelp is to hopefully keep others from the awful experiences I've recently had with the Orange Coast Memorial Center. I am currently 6 months pregnant and was experiencing heavy bleeding which to me warranted a trip to the ER. The people in the ER were helpful although there was not much they could do other than put me in a wheelchair and take me to Labor and Delivery. When we got to Labor and Delivery I was given a room and the most awful nurse I've ever had to deal with. I have no issues talking with someone with broken english as long as they are patient with me. This woman got irritated with me when I asked her to repeat what she was asking me. She was very forceful and actually cut me when trying to examine my cervix. I was unaware a nurse was even allowed to examine that far! I was in this hospital for 5 hours and did not see a doctor once. All I had was this awful and rough nurse. I'm not sure if it's just me but considering I'm 6 months pregnant I would imagine a doctor should take a look to ensure I am not going into premature labor. This is also the hospital where I am supposed to be giving birth! Will I have to deliver the baby myself? Or will a bimbo nurse be floating around to hurt my baby too?I was discharged and told to see me doctor 2 weeks from now. I left the hospital with a huge copay, no answers as to why I was bleeding, and cut private parts. Needless to say I will be calling human resources this week. So please, do yourself the favor and go somewhere that will actually have a doctor that will see you and nurses that will care for you.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Ariya Medrano,"Back in January 2011 I had some Gastrointestinal Surgery here and was admitted for two days to recover from the surgery. The surgery went perfect, no issues or problems. The stay at this hospital was probably better than most. I had a private room, this is what happens when you pay full 'Pop' for a medical procedure because you no longer have insurance. RN's were great and attentive, NA's the same, the Surgeon actually came by the next morning and visited, his PA's visited as well too! I had really no issue with the Staff, in general. The only three issues were: 1. Why do Hospitals find it necessary to start all their noisy work from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am right outside your room. Hospital - Patient Recovery - Quiet. Nope not here.2. The Bed sucked - Hard as granite.3. The Floor Supervising RN at the time of discharge spoke so little English that I had to keep asking her to repeat the instructions and I could not convince her that I already had all my medications that morning prior to her interviewing me for discharge. She made me take all the Medications again, which I just kept in my mouth and spit out after she left. I had to get my regular RN back to explain everything to me again. Oh and my RN told me that EVERYONE has problems with this Nurse...The Doctors, and all the Staff, no one can understand a word out of her mouth! But I only had to deal with her for two hours and then I was out of there!I guess if you have to stay in a Hospital, private ones are the best and paying full 'Pop' out of pocket for everything gets you the best care they can give.",4,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine
Jorgie Wolfe,"Judging by the reviews, it seems the ER is competent at taking care of emergencies but in my experience, it's possible to wait many hours without a doctor giving any diagnosis while watching doctors, nurses and many staff standing around talking, sharing cell phone photos, discussing their hair/makeup and generally doing nothing. It's very frustrating when you are with an elderly person who needs to eat and is in a lot of discomfort. My mother was put in a bed in a hallway jammed next to countless people as they were wheeled out to surgery or to be admitted. We had a ""drive by"" doctor who would walk by us while yelling out jokes to my mother about her possible condition. After 4 hours, I finally got the doctor to talk to me and when he told me how he was going to treat her, I had to beg him to look at her hospital record to show him that his treatment was not possible. Â I am still disgusted with our experience and I am writing this to tell yelpers that if they can wait to see their personal doctor and avoid the ER, maybe it's best to do so.",1,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Any time I had pain, they took care of it as quickly as possible.The hospital is clean and hygienic.The food is often very delicious but can be dry or gross if you are stuck on a special diet. They try very hard to make it not the common hospital fare. The paramedics who brought me here the last time and my guest have both stated that the cafeteria food is amazing. I was not able to try it, since I was the patient all 3 times.They have t.v. with movies, computer games like solitaire, and about 20 channels to entertain yourself with.The beds are as comfortable as can be when you are stuck laying in them for extended periods of time.I highly recommend this hospital to anyone who wants quality care.",5,MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center,General Medicine

Dale Roman,"This hospital is so amazing. Seriously. Every unit is awesome. I volunteered here when i was 16 since i want to be a nurse and get the feel of the hospital setting. Everytime a family member is sick they go to this hospital. I have never ever had a negative experience here and neither has anyone else i know. My friend was diagnosed with cancer due to a dr here finding lytic lesions in her femur. They saved her life. After going to multiple E.Rs and then ending up at OCM the dr on call had seriously wondered how no other physician had seen it. She is healthy and free of cancer, High Grade Fibroblastic Osteosarcoma thanks to this hospital. Thank god. I've been here a few times. Since i've been lucky enough to be healthy all my life. Although i did not deliver my baby at this hospital because my family was all born at FV regional and my ob didnt work out of OCM. I'm really sick currently and was taken to the E.R at about 3am yesterday (friday) and i had all male nurses, i adored them. They were sassy in a good way, made me feel comfortable and were super caring and on guard. I can only remember one of their names, Brett. But they were all waaay awesome. They dealt with me being a baby about the I.V and flu test. The on call physician, older man tall with white hair was super awesome too. I have 0 complaints about this hospital.

I was actually in a pretty bad shape; couldn't move or talk, severe cold sweats and almost losing consciousness. Â Two clerks at the front desk checked my blood pressure and said that I need to wait in line until somebody will call and take me inside the emergency department. Â My husband asked if doctor can see me because I was in a very bad condition. Â He was screaming for help, but it was completely useless. Â All I remembered that I couldn't even hold myself in a wheelchair that they gave me and was loosing consciousness periodically.

In an hour, I felt that I am back to reality, thanks God, and we just left... without getting any help at all. Â All I can recommend to people who have real life threatening situation - CALL 911 and arrive to hospital in ambulance; it's the only chance to get some help right away. Otherwise, you can die in the emergency room without any help, can stop breathing, etc. Â I used to like this hospital, been there and had a lot of help from nurses and doctors before.

Anwen Elliott,"So....where do I start?? I have been seeing Dr. Riley since I was 22, and I am now 42, so...20 years! I have gone from being straight out of college kid with my boyfriend, to getting pregnant, and having 4 kids with Dr. Riley. She is exactly the OB that I would want, if I were to think about what I would want in an OB: intelligent, funny, no-nonsense, and a quick thinker. Â With my first baby, I experienced a scare while pregnant on a road trip with my husband. We were in Colorado, and at the time, the pain I was experiencing made me think I was having a miscarriage. Having never been pregnant before, I was terrified. We went to the local ER, and got on the phone with Dr. Riley to figure out what to do. After careful questioning and talking to the ER Doctor, she determined that it was more than likely my appendix that was about to burst, and she asked the Dr. to take my appendix out. She told me it would be ok, and was calm, collected, and told me she would see me as soon as I returned. I had the surgery, it was indeed my appendix, they took it out, and my baby (4.5 months pregnant) was fine. She went on to deliver that baby (girl) and 3 others smoothly and without any issues. Each time, her humor and knowledge made me always feel like I was with a friend: someone I knew who cared about what was going on with me, and who know how to steer the crazy process of pregnancy. When it came down to my last baby, the 4th baby she delivered in 6 years, I told her I wanted no epidural, natural birth (which I hadn't had for the rest) and after a couple of hours of labor, I went with an epidural. Thing is, once the epidural kicked in, the baby was ready to show up 20 minutes later. Dr. Riley was called and she rushed to John Muir from her office to make it just in time to deliver. She laughed and encouraged me while I yelled obscenities, and I cried and was so grateful when I held our last baby girl. She has always been comforting, kind and wonderful. MaryJean, who has been with her forever, is equally as kind and efficient. I would never consider going to anyone else for this most intimate and magical experience. I look forward to seeing her every year for my checkups, and I can't recommend her highly enough. Seriously. Love.",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology

A year later I explained I'm still having the symptom, she once again insisted she's never heard of anyone having it. (Instead of saying something like, ""That must be difficult. I'm not familiar with that but let me research it.). Very dismissive. Turns out it's not an uncommon symptom, I learned after one google search. Who needs a female GYN who is dismissive of symptoms and makes you regret even asking. She doesn't remember key components of my case, today I told her gently how I feel like I'm a new patient every time in that respect.

Reanne Rayner,"What a horrible experience. Im in the first trimester of my first pregnancy so things are scary and new to us. Everything was very planned and we started trying for baby on our honeymoon. Needless to say since it was planned I have been tracking my periods and ovulation religiously. Going into the appointment based on my last period and the date we believed we conceived (on the honeymoon), I thought I was 6 weeks and 3 days pregnant. First we covered some issues I had with my cervix pre pregnancy which was a diagnosis of cervical dysplasia that has since been treated by a naturopath and I no longer test positive before. She didnt believe that I had cervical dysplasia in the first place because she couldnt see it in her system. I told her everything was a blur when I did the tests and I was back and forth between county and planned parenthood so she may not be able to see the records. I have the paperwork at home showing the diagnosis but whatever if she doesnt believe me. After covering health history she told me she wanted to do an ultrasound. I never would have thought they would need to do an ultrasound so soon when I had zero complications and was only thought to be 6 weeks. I wasnt comfortable with it but my husband told me to trust the doctor. I asked if there was any risk factors and she said there was zero risk factors for ultrasounds. Im not sure if I believe this but I guess women do them all the time so I finally gave in. When I consented she condescendingly told me that she didnt have to do it if I didnt want too. At this point I just wanted the appointment over so I told her to go ahead. Once she did the trans vaginal ultrasound the first thing she noticed is the sac didnt appear to have anything inside it. She immediately points it out and says it looks like Im having a miscarriage or am going to have one soon. She tells me I can either wait for it to happen naturally, medically induce it or surgically remove it. My husband and I are both sitting there trying to hold it together and understand whats going on and she continued to go on forever about how to remove the sac. She mentions that she has had 3 miscarriages and she understands how I must be feeling. After all this she then tells me ""or maybe your numbers are wrong and you are only 5 weeks pregnant"". She then points out that the ultrasound machine says that Im 5 weeks pregnant. So which is it? Is the baby dead or am I 5 weeks? Why bring up miscarriage at all if the machine says Im 5 weeks? She then has the nerve to tell me that my due date would be 9-11 and thats not a very good birthday (as if anyone delivers on their due date but either way how tacky!).

She is supportive, knowledgeable, and just really good at her job- as is the rest of her team right down to the front office staff.I've read some complaints about Dr. Riley here, and mostly they seem to be centered around her not being kind of a touchy-feely doctor and maybe not spending as much time as people would like... Personally, I found her to be very friendly and willing to answer my questions. I had a very friendly OB/GYN BEFORE Dr. Riley as well, and while she was very nice and supportive and wanted to hear about birth plans etc, she failed me entirely as a physician. What I want in a OB/GYN is someone who is competent and honest- as Dr Riley is. If things don't go to plan, I want to know I have a doctor who is going to HANDLE it, and I feel she is that kind of doc. I absolutely want to be an informed patient, and I want to have say in my own care and the care of my baby, but at the end of the day I want to trust the doctor I have selected to make good decisions for me when it counts. If I don't trust them to do that then I am with the wrong doctor. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Riley.",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Muneeb Durham,"This was my first time at this office, I went in for my yearly exam and I wasn't sure why the office got such horrible reviews! Â My appointment was with Amy, the nurse practitioner and she was amazing! She was really sweet, knowledgeable and had great information to provide. We are planning to have a baby this year and she gave me great advice and information! I felt really comfortable with her. Â I did not meet Dr. Riley, which is why I gave my review of 4 stars Â and her front desk receptionist was not very friendly, but the other receptionist/woman working at the desk upfront was very nice and helpful! She was not very personable and seemed like she didn't want to be there but Amy was great, I would go back to see her!",4,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Brooklyn Pugh,Dr Riley and her team are both very professional and friendly to their patients. Dr Riley was with me the whole pregnancy and I didn't have problems. I'll go to Dr Riley again once I become pregnant with another baby ;),5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Renesmee Cresswell,"I am little on the fence here. Â I like Dr. Riley. Â I have seen her for a few years. Â I only get my routine stuff done because I don't have kids and not planning on or trying to get prego. Â I got a IUD from Planned Parenthood for free a few years ago. Â Now its time to replace it. Â They wont let me do a routine exam at the same time as replacement. Â As per insurance. Â Plus, as per insurance, I have to pay in advance for the IUD, they are like $800!! Not cheap. Â So I have to call and see what they will pay out. Â I mean wft. Â I have am dual covered. Â This makes me very angry. Â But it's not Dr. Riley's fault. Â I went in recently with the poor reviews I read on my mind thinking about finding a new doctor. Â I waited 30min for Dr Riley in the room once the nurse came in an gave me the gown. Â I mean really 30 min! Â Once she was in the room she was really nice as she always is. Â Re-assuring and what not. Â It's hard for me not to like her. Â She is nice to me. Â To each their own experience I guess",4,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Kiah Kline,"I don't know where to start but I've had the worst experience with Dr. Riley. I've only had two appointments with her and both times were terrible. She told me that I have a misshaped uterus and an enlarged fibroid at my 8 week ultrasound to confirm pregnancy. I was really concerned and she did not give me any sort of explanation. When I went to a different office for genetic screening, everything was normal. My uterus was normal and my blood work was normal. Dr. Riley had me freaking out for no reason. I really don't appreciate the fact that she had told me false information and never explained herself thoroughly. She doesn't take time with her patients. I understand that she must be really busy but it's her job to answer my questions and not just rush me out of your office. I'm not paying you out of pocket for shitty service. Cancelled my last appointment with her and going somewhere else.",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Natan Greaves,"I actually did not see Dr. Riley, but her Nurse Practitioner Amy. Â Amy was fantastic! The entire staff was, but for the first time in over a year I feel like I was listened to and got answers. Â Amy took the time (which was quite a long time I will admit) to listen and take notes of all the symptoms I have having, and not once did she rush me, or make me feel like my concerns weren't valid. She is wonderful at what she does and she deserves a raise!",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Saanvi Smyth,"Very unhappy with multiple experiences with Dr. Riley and her staff. Â She was recommend to me, because i'm new to the area and found out I was pregnant. I have tried and tried, but she can be rude and at times she seems like she's in to much of a hurry to hear my concerns. This is my first pregnancy and it can be overwhelming. I want to feel like my Dr. is there to help, not to make me feel stupid. I loved her Nurse practitioner, but unfortunately I only saw her once. Disappointed... looking for a new OB.",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Charlize Pearson,"I had emergency surgery at John Muir by Dr. Riley. I had never met her before or heard of her. After surgery, I never spoke to her but briefly for about 30 seconds. The first thing, was my pain control post surgery. Right out of surgery, she ordered me to have oral narcotics. I cried and told the nurse I could not take them, but ""that's what the doctor ordered"". So naturally, I threw them up. So in top of being in excruciating pain, I was forced to throw up pills before she'd give me any dilaudid. Ridiculous and horrible. But I would say the absolute most unbelievable and unprofessional thing was when I went in for a follow up a few months later, Dr. Riley accused me of insurance fraud upon my first meeting with her. You see, I did not have insurance at the time of the surgery. But apparently John Muir had an old (really old) policy in its records for some reason. So basically she was outraged that she did surgery on me when I was uninsured, she flat out accused me of lying and telling the hospital I had insurance when I did no such thing, the intake records easily prove it. I was too busy dying in the absolute worse pain of my life and internally bleeding to commit fraud, I did not have that much focus to go out of my way to trick you Dr Riley, so sorry.I could not believe it. I have never had such an unprofessional doctor in my life. She continued to accuse me of lying and going on about how upset she was that she was bothered in the middle of the night to do surgery on an uninsured patient. Like wow lady. Just wow. To say those things to a patient is just, insane. So yeah, I would recommend skipping this woman if you're looking for a gyno. She also has no idea how to treat endometriosis and will only want to put you on Lupron, which thank God she was horrible to me because it made me find an endo specialist in Los Gatos that knows how to treat my condition and treat patients. So it worked out in the end. I do thank her for doing the surgery and not removing my ovaries, and would have gladly set up a payment plan with her since her bill wasn't outrageous in comparison to the rest, but now she can get in line with the rest and wait for my medical bankruptcy. She can keep her yuppie BS.",2,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Ryder Carter,"Ok, this place is averaging out three stars only because NP Amy gets a solid 5 stars. She is spot on with her customer service, very empathetic, just a lovely person. The perfect medical care provider.I don't know if I've actually met Dr Riley before, and this has been my Gyni for the past 7 years so that's interesting. Reading some of the reviews, it looks like I may need to look around before getting pregnant.The reason it only gets 3 stars is because of the front desk staff, I'm not quite sure of their titles (medical assistants? Medical receptionists?). I found them to be just off. Â First of all I never got my courtesy call the day before to confirm my appointment time. I know that sounds like such a small thing, but I know they offer this service and basically rely on it to get my appointment time right. When I got there they confirmed my phone # with me - I changed my number with them 4 years ago and for some reason they had reverted back to the old one. Next was that my appointment was running late; I understand sometimes people run late, so after waiting 30 mins beyond my appointment time I shared with them I had a meeting at work at needed to be out the door within the next 30 mins, did they think it was feasible for me to be seen and out the door by then. They were 100% confident it was possible. So it definitely got awkward as I sat there for another 30 mins. Not one did they look at me or acknowledge me and apologize for the mis estimate. Finally as I am waiting in the room and NP Amy is about to come in I hear one of the receptionists come running up to her to let her know I'm in a rush. I mean, at least whisper so I can't hear. Plus, I was in a rush. Considering my appointment was at 10, my next meeting is at 11:30 in Berkeley, Â I've obviously given up hope of making it.I just found my interactions with them left me ruffled. Why can't Amy get the support she needs on mornings like this when she is obviously over booked??",3,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Dawson Rankin,"Dr. Riley has been my OB/GYN for 15 years and delivered the second 2 of my 4 children. I so appreciate Dr. Riley's professionalism, care, kindness, and attentiveness. I had complicated pregnancies/deliveries (Premature Rupture of Membranes) and Dr. Riley was proactive in getting me early detection screening to treat accordingly. She showed sensitivity, concern, interest and compassion during my visits of panic and worry. She has a great sense of humor for those moments that need a lift. I highly recommend Dr. Riley. She's the best!",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Nathalie Gay,"Zero bedside manner is how I would describe Dr Christine Riley. I've never had a doctor treat me so rudely. At the 5 month mark of my pregnancy, the sonogram technician mentioned that my baby was much bigger than normal. I told this to her and she said that I'm fat so that's why the baby was big. I was a size 8 before the pregnancy. I ended up delivering an 11 pound baby thanks to her negligence. She profusely apologized for ""missing"" it. I'm pregnant withy second baby and will be looking for a doc who treats their patients with respect and takes the time to listen to their concerns. Under no circumstances should anyone see this doctor!!!!",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Inayah Rees,"Dr. Riley is AMAZING! Â I have been a patient for 15 years. Â She delivered my two children and I drive over 15 miles to see her at her office. Â She is the perfect blend of being personable and caring AND very good at what she does. Â She is smart, on the cutting edge, and consciencious. Â She makes those unpleasant lady visits more than bearable and her staff is excellent as well.",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Chyna Brookes,"Awful! I wouldn't recommend this this doctor to anyone who works or has a life. Her office called and canceled my appointment 3 times. Â It must be nice to make your own hours, unfortunately, I don' have that luxury.",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Asiya Short,"I have been a patient with Dr. Riley for 3 years now and I think she is a great doctor. I would recommend to anyone. She is extremely tentative to your need when you have an appointment with her. Like other OB doctors, she sometimes need to cancel your appointment due to an emergency delivery or something... very normal. But I truly feel I can ask her anything and she would give me all the possibilities and options that would help me make a good and educated decision. I can ask her any type of questions and she will reply back with her best knowledge. She never made me do any not necessary tests or exams. I work for the medical field and I know if she does, it would be illegal. If that is the case you are experiencing (with any doctor) you must file a claim with your insurance even the medical board. Some doctors are just more cautious than others because they want to provide you with the utmost care. Especially with anything dealing with GYN, because usually there are no symptom for GYN issues such as cancer until the late stage of the cancer. I feel very safe and protected with Dr. Riley. If one day I do have something wrong with me, I know Dr. Riley will discover it at the early stage and help me cure it...so I can continue to live a healthy life.",5,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology
Elias Dawe,"Having not been good about seeing doctors, I finally made an appointment with Dr. Riley's office. Since they try to keep Dr. Riley available for more urgent needs, I agreed to have my initial appointment with Amy, the NP.

Â About 7 months later I had to make another appointment after discovering my stupid now ex boyfriend cheated on me and again I had Amy and she was sympathetic and caring....even when I broke down she hugged me and made me feel so much better!

Â Dr. Riley was there every step of the way, answering my questions, and just supporting us. Â I saw her a lot (naturally) during my twin pregnancy and developed a pretty close relationship with her. Â She is personable, funny and incredibly talented. Â I'm telling you, she is the one you want delivering your baby!

Saskia Sargent,"Was a patient of Dr. Riley prior to my pregnancy.

After waiting an hour after my 1:10 pm appt, and with no update on status, I walked out - the first time ever to do that.

Abiha Moody,"If it were possible to give a ZERO STAR review, I would. Â The staff is generally rude and condescending, not to mention they don't listen.

Â I have an OB-GYN for a reason! Â Secondly, getting refills is like an act of congress. Â The staff lies and says they never received requests from the pharmacy until you sit on the phone with them while you wait for the fax or email to come through for the request. Â Lastly, while I was in the process of looking for a new OB-GYN (Dr. Michelle Bergman), I no-showed for an appointment because I forgot to cancel it. Â Would you believe this office actually sent a vial in to pathology to be tested under MY name? Â I fought it with my insurance.

Elin Gill,"So I am writing this from a Husbands point of view (if you only read a part of this read the last part). At the time me and my wife where unmarried, not very wealthy but very Â much in love and decided to have a baby. We picked her Dr. Riley off the insurance web site and never really looked her up. After we told her we were not married and she saw some of my tattoos she asked if she should call social services (yes that really happened). At the time we thought it was really weird and looking back a little insulting. We never really felt like she was involved at all on the times we did see her she was usually late one time in particular we waiting for over an hour after our appointment she told us that she had a new client that was ""HI Maintenance"" or as we took it more important than us. The last part kind of sums up why I would never recommend her, minutes after my daughter was born I was so over come with joy I kept saying to my daughter ""Hi little girl I love you , Hi little girl"" Â and while still attending to my girlfriend she snaps at me ""does she have a name can you stop calling her baby girl"" in a crazy rude tone.(PS the only reason she got two stars was cause of the nurse Amy and receptionist Rachel they were amazing and always made us feel at home.",2,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology

Lillie-Mae Holcomb,"DON'T GO HERE. THIS PLACE JUST WANTS YOUR MONEY AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. THIS IS A WARNING TO ALL MOMS OUT THERE! I was pregnant and had a miscarriage in my first trimester. My first ultrasound with Dr. Riley was about 3 minutes long, I told her about my previous high risk pregnancy with gestational diabetes. Did not care, nor guided me about my diet and she said we will talk about it in my next visit. My second visit was with her nurse (not even with her) due to a yeast infection. I asked if I can see the baby, she said no. Well, I miscarried 4 days after that day, after their refusal for me to do an ultrasound to see if the baby is okay. She said there is no reason to think that the baby is NOT ok and I just need to relax! WHEN I DID, I LOST THE BABY! When I started bleeding, they said you cannot stop a miscarriage! I felt helpless, lost and was so heartbroken. I kept thinking if only Amy allowed me to see the baby that baby, who knows if that would have made a difference. Maybe she still has a heartbeat and I needed to rest. My story doesn't end there. We went to ER since my bleeding happened on the weekend and as anxious parents, we need to know if the baby will be okay. That Monday we saw Dr. Riley, her first statement was, why did you go to the ER? She kept on and on about how a miscarriage is not an emergency. Are you fre@king kidding me?! To you it's not, because obviously you don't give a shi@t! But when it is your own life and you want to know if that child is safe, of course if it is a damn emergency and we are paying for it so who cares! The next visit was even more worse. I brought my son with me during the checkup. I didn't have any choice and it was the only available appointment they had. Dr. Riley snapped and said, you know what I cannot work like this. I cannot work when your son is all over the place and you cannot control him.. etc. I snapped back and I said, well I didn't have a lot of choice so I have to take him with me. And I said, I already paid you for your service, so I don't know what you wanted to do about that. (I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO SAY THIS TO HER! HER NERVE FOR INSULTING ME!) She mellowed down after that but man, she is the coldest doctor I have ever met. It is as if she is not a woman, let alone a mom. Who the hell does she think she is to talk down on women as if she is way better. When I miscarried, she said she had 3 and she knows it is a bummer. That's all she said. In my head, just because you already went through this, doesn't make our pain less real or our needs less important. The more you should be understanding, compassionate and the more you should ensure it doesn't happen to us. SAVE YOUR BABY, DON'T GO HERE. Even my husband said, the doctor's a bitch! So heartless!",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology

Alison Milne,"Dr Riley was my OBGYN during my first pregnancy. Â After seven appointments she still didn't know my name and by the seventh month she still asked me if I was having a boy or girl. Â She always acted like it was the first time she had seen me. I understand that she sees a lot of patients, but having a baby is a pretty intimate experience and you should not feel like you are at a drive up window at McDonald's. Â I knew that I should have changed Drs pretty early on but I didn't because I kept thinking things would get better. Â By the eighth month I knew she was not the right Doctor for me but it was too late. Â I had a feeling that she wouldn't be there for the delivery and I was right. Â The morning I was admitted she called in sick and a different Dr delivered my baby. The next morning Dr Riley visited me in the hospital. Â I felt like it was more of a formality and putting a check in a box than a caring visit. Â Even though I tore pretty bad during delivery and was in a lot of pain, she did not do any kind of examination of me and she gave me no instructions or advice. Â When she left my husband and I turned to each other and laughed. Â We were both thinking the same thing - first - that her visit was a complete waste of our time and second - that it must have been a criteria that she had to visit in order to get paid. Â I did some research on how she gets paid because I was pretty upset about the situation. What I found is that she gets paid a package price regardless of whether she delivers your baby or not. Bottom line - if you care about having a trusting relationship with your OB go to someone else.",1,Christine M Riley,Obstetrics & Gynecology

Lily-Grace Meyers,"I had recently moved to the area and was referred to Dr. Riley by a friend. She is a competent doctor but I would not recommend her to others. She is not particularly understanding of the anxiety that goes along with high risk pregnancies. And most importantly she refused to return my phone call after the birth when I had some difficulties breastfeeding. A lactation specialist suggested I take a medication that needed a prescription. When I called Dr. Riley to discuss she did not take my call and had her receptionist call me back to say that Dr. Riely did not believe in prescribing ""X"" medication. (which was not even the one I wanted to discuss!). Long short, she refused to discuss the situation at all and had a non medical staff member deliver the message. PLUS, the staff member acknowldged that Dr. Riley often puts her in this position and she did not appreciate it either. She suggested that I see her nurse practitioner for my 6 week follow up.

NO blood sugar.Dr. Kwon actually says she usually doesn't bother testing for these, since if you are young enough she is only going to recommend diet and exercise anyway....but personally, I would like to know if I am pre-diabetic etc...So...I had to ask Dr. Kwon for another lab order for lipids and blood sugar. Â I had to wake up early again. Skip breakfast again. And get blood draw AGAIN!To make things even worse, Dr. Kwon prescribed a medicine that made things worse, and a simple over the counter solution solved it. Really wish I had just done things on my own.So in the end:1. I did not get the physical I asked for and had to pay $25 for an ""office visit"". None of that was explained to me. Just the usual: We bill you for what we feel like after the fact.2. I had to get my blood tested twice, each time there was another $25 copay3. I am out $75 in what should have been a completely covered routine yearly physicalSutter Health (and Kaiser too) like to put on the face of being progressive medical establishments, but to me, they now represent textbook examples of what NOT TO DO in medicine.How are we meant to take care of our health, if all you do is take blood pressure, temperature, and chat with us at physicals? Even a lipid panel and blood sugar are not enough in terms of diagnostics, but Sutter Health will not even order these. What about liver enzymes, thyroid, and other important biomarkers? I rarely shout on the internet, but:IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH AND PREVENTING DISEASE, PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE!",1,Melissa Kwon,Internal Medicine
Katerina Glass,"Came in with stomach pain, she said ""I don't know what it is, maybe take some ibuprofen"", billed me $350 for like a 5 minute conversation.

Definitely a great doctor to have by your side as you navigate life!",5,Lara N. Pickle,Family Practice
Chenai O'Brien,Dr. Pickle is amazing best dr I ever had and I'm keeping her! She actually listens to me and that's unfortunately hard to find! Any time shes not sure of something she sends me to a specialist and I've had horrible doctors for so many years and complained about my symptoms and they all said it was just stress!!! Dr Pickle sent me to specialist who found so many issues and I was finally diagnosed with a few different conditions!!! And it was biological! I felt like crying from relief that I finally got a diagnosis! Thank you so much Dr. Pickle! I've had horrible experiences with both Sutter (350 Rhode Island) but everything ran here even the front is well run. The call center is just amazing!,5,Lara N. Pickle,Family Practice

She will not follow up on emails, phone calls, or lab results, until several days to weeks later. I guess that's ok if you don't really care about your health or if you aren't concerned about hearing back from her in a timely manner regarding any questions you might have or lab results.Clearly she doesn't care about or respect her patients very much.",1,Lara N.

Breanna Whitfield,"Very bad experience. Front office was disorganized. I was clear what I wanted to accomplish with my appointment when I made it. I scheduled an annual exam several weeks in advance and on the day of my appointment Dr Pickle was a half an hour late and told me she did not have time to do my annual exam and a pap. Â She said she was very busy ( like I'm not?) and I would have to make 2 separate appointments. I said to just charge me for another copay so I could get everything done. I was told when I made the appointment that it was my initial consultation appointment and I would have 45 minutes to let her know everything I needed to. She said she didn't t have it down for that. And then was pretty condescending about the whole thing. So, I canceled and made appointment with another Dr at another office. She may be an ok Dr. but not a great attitude and not respectful of this patients time. It was a disaster. I've never just walked out of a Dr appointment but I did this time. Glad I did. I will never go there again. I have decent insurance so glad I had another option.",1,Lara N. Pickle,Family Practice

Jeremy Knight,"I strongly advise that you chose another doctor. I was using modest amounts of coffee, alcohol, and nicotine to kill the time while confined to a chair with a badly damaged ankle. When the ankle healed I stopped all 3 simultaneously and suffered the expected withdrawal symptoms, and on the 4th day I was still experiencing an uncomfortable feeling of dread, so I called the terrific Dr. Jonathan Lee, hoping to get a mild sedative prescribed to cool my brain off for the last couple days while my body adjusted.Dr. Lee wasn't available, but Dr. Pickle took me on short notice. Instead of the half dozen Valium I was hoping for, she ordered an expensive ultrasound for me and prescribed 90 doses of Gabapentin, which got me stoned (remember I was trying to purge) as well as an evil drug called Naltrexone, which freaked me out , and Clonondine (probably the only one I needed), which she then told me not to take. She also suggested vaping cannibis.The ultrasound was ostensibly to check out for liver damage, but it had already been examined during a colonoscopy/endoscopy 6 months before and found to be okay.Lastly, she called me in for another session in which the largely spent talking about my diet although I have access to a dietician from my health care provider and I eat well, anyway. A complete waste of time, but that didn't stop her from scheduling a one hour appointment, for no evident reason, which I canceled later.By the time I got wise to her, Dr. Pickle had managed to rack up bills to at least $2,000, mostly paid by Medicare (I'm 66) and Blue Shield, but still over $500 to me, and I'm a very low income social security guy. I've never sued a doctor before, but I will file a Small Claims action against her as well as a complaint with the California Medical Review Board. I really think that I was considerably worse off after Dr. Pickle's treatment than I was before. Gabapentin just stupefies you and is very habit forming, Naltrexone is used for drug addicts and alcohol abusers, of which I was neither. Look 'em up on Wiki.I opened up a Yelp account just to warn people about Dr. Pickle. I gave her a chance to explain her bizarre treatment, but she has declined to comment. I'll take the opportunity to praise Dr. Lee and Dr. Robert Elston, the gastroenterologist who scoped me and examined my liver, and Dr. Marina McGiver, who first diagnosed the anemia which lead to the feinting that first caused my injury and pointed out a bad mistake I made trying to self-treat myself. All will get 5 stars, but if you like getting stoned and freaked out by prescription drugs, fasting, taking tests normally used for pregnancy, wasting time, and paying exorbitant bills, look no further than Dr. Lara Pickle!",1,Lara N.

Without this medicine I don't think I would be here today. Most providers I have seen in the past didn't care nearly as much as Mary Lynn does.

Jakub Galindo,"I have seen many medical providers throughout my life, and Mary Lynn Martin at Midtown Family Medicine is by far the best. First, appointments are easy to get, and it is not unusual for an appointment to last 30 minutes or even an hour. Second, her follow-up is second to none. I have received call backs as late as 7 p.m. Third, she is collaborative in her approach. She genuinely wants to know what I think, what is important to me. She is willing to consider whatever research I have found on the internet. Most importantly, I believe she really cares about me as a patient. I've had other practitioners that cared...when I was in front of them--but out of sight, out of mind. Not Mary Lynn Martin. Sometimes a few days after I have seen her, she will call, saying some version of ""I've been thinking about your issue, and I wonder if we might try...."" If she doesn't know the answer to something or is unfamiliar with an issue, she will say so, and then she will try to find the answer. I used to work at a medical school.

Neither YOU, nor your ailment is a priority for these doctors. MONEY is their priority. Â When you call to make an appointment, they do not ask who you are or what your ailment is...they ask if you have insurance. Whether you are in excruciating pain from shingles or terrified because you think you have a lump in your breast, THEY DO NOT CARE! If you do not have insurance they will refuse you any medical care.

Yvonne Montoya,"This doctor's office is a wreck. Â A coworker recommended that my boyfriend go here (to Dr. Thompson) since it was close to the house and my own doctor is a 25 minute drive away. Â Biggest mistake we could have made. Â They are housed in a crummy little office off Broadway and their staff isn't very personable. Â He went for an initial physical/ check-up as a new patient and also explained that he had been having a lot of stomach pain, especially in the mornings, and was wanting to figure out why. Â Instead of trying to get to the bottom of this, they just brushed it off and told him to make sure his diet is nutritious. Â He works out 3-5 times a week and eats a very healthy diet, so this was not very constructive advice. Â About 8 months down the line, he was at work at was struck by a large metal pole on a semi. It hit him with about 150 pounds of pressure to his jaw, enough force that it broke several of his teeth. Â When he came to Dr. Thompson again, he wasn't available and saw ""Ashley"", the nurse practitioner. Â She prescribed him Tylenol 2, which on any website says it is prescribed for MILD pain, cough and arthritis. Â He was treated like a child and was told that anything sufficient to help treat his pain ""made the doctor uncomfortable"" as if to imply that my boyfriend would abuse or misuse the medication. Â  After having his face smashed in with a huge piece of steel, I would expect a little more concern out of a doctor. Â Then they billed the appointment incorrectly to insurance and instead of wanting to work with us, they chose to argue. Â Needles to say, he is now switching to my doctor in Kansas.

I went out to my car and cried bc she was so amazing and I felt heard. I look forward to moving forward with her as my PCP. The rest of the experience was good. I arrived 15 min early and was in an exam room by my appt time. Check in/out was easy and the new patient info was online so I didn't have to worry about paperwork.

Leela Mccaffrey,"I work at a competing clinic in the city, so keep in mind giving a good review here doesn't help me in the slightest. But in all honesty, nothing, and I do really mean nothing would get me to switch to a different clinic short of this place closing its doors. Our entire household goes to this clinic. I see Dr. Delaney, fiance sees Dr. Chapman, and mother is now going here instead of KU Family Medicine, seeing Dr. Bollinger. However, EVERY doctor we've seen when our normal doctor isn't available has been nothing but professional and courteous. Just don't go in expecting the unrealistic.We actually drive further to go here, and for good reason. The doctors and all the staff are hands down the best. Now, some people on here have made the valid complaint of wait times. There are times where you will be waiting a while to be seen, but this is a very busy clinic (for good reason). Arrive early because you have to check in and complete paperwork, bring a book or a well-charged cell phone. People who are truly sicker will generally be seen first, this is the way medicine works! Same goes for being stuck on hold for the triage nurse. They are only one person, and they can only help one person at a time. It sucks, but the alternative is going to urgent care or the ER, which is usually a lot more expensive with a lot less care and compassion.There is full lab available on site, as well as radiology. There is a nice, well decorated and spacious waiting area with a dedicated children's area. Every time we've gone, the only time someone who arrived after us and went back before we did truly was in need to be seen first. When I had a serious issue with my stomach and bowels, I was seen that night and was able to see my doctor and get a plan of action set up, leading to being referred to an outside specialist. The staff always finds a way to try and get you in, and save for a few very human mistakes on getting a medication or two called in properly, have been completely wonderful to deal with!Now to address the naysayers... About the wait times, EVERY single time I have been here, the wait has been short. There has only ever been 2 times I had to wait more than 15 minutes in the lobby. Once was on my first time there due to filling out new patient paperwork (amazing... that takes time people...) and the other was for an injection nurse on a Saturday when the flu was going around the clinic and they were very short staffed (medical workers get exposed to everything and get sick too!). Each time, I was amazingly still in the back within 45 minutes.. and I've honestly never seen people wait longer than 30 minutes to be called back when I've gone there with family and waited for them to come back out. Even during the times when the lobby was completely full. You wait a long time, tell the front desk staff, because something has gotten lost in the shuffle. Communication is key.As for waiting in the room, yes, there are times where I've waited in the room for a while. But working in medicine, I've learned that people demand an hour of attention during their 15-minute appointment. They will come in with 1 complaint on the appointment and give the doctor a laundry list of issues the second they walk in the door. This means every other patient will be waiting. Doctors/nurses do not have time machines. If every patient does this, everything WILL run behind. At a certain point they HAVE to cut you off to see the next person. It's only fair to everyone.Calling for refills... you want a refill placed, yet you ignore the very clear message that states that if you need a refill, the PHARMACY has to be the one to place that call. Again, the standard operating procedure in medicine. Yet are surprised when you call and they don't refill it for you? Appointments... the phone very clearly also give you your number in line. 8 people ahead of you for the same department? It's going to take a little bit of time. People take time to schedule. it also takes time to find an appointment that works for both parties. That is why you are on hold. Arrived past your appointment... yep, you need to reschedule. Not their fault, it's YOURS. Period.Rude staff... I've never had a poor experience from the front desk staff, the doctors, the nurses... anyone. And I have personally apologized to them for people that at times are some of the rudest people I have ever seen in public. I have personally seen a patient cuss out the receptionists' over asking for their name and date of birth (which everyone is required to ask for in medicine to ensure we are working in the right chart). Respect given requires respect received.Lab result calls... Everyone in our household always seem to get their results called back. Also, it's easily accessible online through the portal at any time of day.tl;dr- OUR FAMILY LOVES THIS PLACE!!!

I sent a message through the portal addressing this fact that it is my decision as to whether I want all these damn tests done. Then the truth comes out in a reply from a nurse. The reason why they continue to push all these tests is because if you won't do them, it lowers their grade as a doctor. I really don't think that is my problem. I had already had an MRI and Stress Test ordered by him for no damn reason. Â He orders tests that you have no clue about until the testing site calls you. I have never walked into that building without having blood drawn. He has ordered a consultation with an ENT doctor, has ordered a CT scan, has had Cologuard kit delivered to my house and it is starting to piss me off. Â He tells me that he is trying to save my life. Â NO, he is trying to run my life.

Ross Bennett,"We're pretty new customers here, just a couple years. It is what it is as far as the medical service it provides but their administrative processes have always seemed lacking. There seems to be a lot of redundancy and inconsistencies from visit to visit. Nothing big, just annoying. In the time we have been going there, they had a portal that was working right, for what it was worth. Then, they dropped it and wanted us to join a new portal.We signed up and even used it to check in on for one of our visits, but when we tried to login to pay our bill, the portal is dead! They do not even recognize our account! The birth date does not bring up any way to recover. I call in and of course the only person you can speak to is the nurse on duty, which says, ""I'll send you another invite!"" Wait a minute!It takes about a good half hour to go through all the screens to get through that process, and without any explanation for what happened to our original account, naturally we're hesitant to use it again in the future! Where is the data? I don't think they care!We don't use checks anymore, so looks like we're back to making a special trip to the clinic, just to pay our bill! There's nothing special about that!",3,Clay Platte Family Medicine Clinic,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Pediatricians"
Terrence Wagstaff,The Only two Doctors I see now are McDonald &amp; Delany. They are the best and I really enjoy these two. I've been going to this practice for about 8 years.  Back in 2014 I went to see any doctor available which was Heather Bollinger. She walked in and was disgusted by me from the get go. She said well you look awful so I guess we will run a few tests. When the tests came back she said how dare I get the swine flu and bring it to her office. (How did I know I had swine flu?) She asked me who gave it to me. (Again it's airborne &amp; I don't know) She said it was past the point of helping me. I needed to be quarantined to my room for 6 weeks. Don't go in public or roam my home. I asked what I could take to get better. She said there was nothing and I needed to leave asap. I was so frustrated. I've called and emailed managers and even disputed my bill I got nowhere. It's 4 years now and I refuse to pay her bill all at once so they get small payments now until I am finished. My experience with Danielle Keith was I went in saying I had back issues probably from moving two days before. She insisted I had a Kidney stone. I told her I just needed medicine to help my back I didn't need a pee test. She argued with me. Was short with me like I was wasting her time. I refuse to see her anymore. Another issue I've had is with Scott Kuennen I asked my regular doctor to refill a prescription and he was out of the office. decided to take it upon himself to say I didn't need my meds anymore and I needed to start weening myself off of it by taking half. He does not know my history or the trama that I've incurred for the reason of starting my meds in the beginning. I do not feel he had any right to change something without talking to my Doctor or myself first. I've never even met the man.I've been to Ortiz and Tuton as well. Both acted like I was a waste of their time and no bedside manner. Didn't really listen to my concerns.Granger absolutely has no bedside manner and makes you feel incompetent. He doesn't listen to your concerns. Instead he goes on tangents of what's wrong with you instead of trying to help you. I go there to be helped not to be judged.,2,Clay Platte Family Medicine Clinic,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Pediatricians"
Bronwyn Rios,"I've been here a few times in the past and had good results. Â They worked with my schedule and short wait times when I would arrive for an appointment. Â Dr. Delaney was very good. Â Looks like things have changed. Â I had been meaning to make an appointment for a checkup for a few weeks. Â Today I was in the area over lunch time so I walked in and asked to make an appointment. Â They asked me to sign in and they would be with me as soon a possible. Â I told them I didn't have an appointment I just wanted to make an appointment for a future date. Â They said it didn't matter, I needed to sign in and wait because there were several people ahead of me. Â Really? Â You have several people waiting just to make an appointment?

Paul Macleod,"I'm so very impressed with Dr Meseyton I had moved to Mo from California and had seen numerous doctors before moving to Missouri and they never took enough time to diagnose my medical al issues, I went to Dr Meseyton almost in tears, just out of frustration of not being heard Well the very first time I visited Dr Meseyton I knew this would be a completely different experience and within minutes she diagnosed my need for surgical intervention I also had my mother to care for with Alzheimer's/dementia with no help and the doctor understood my needs I actually had a toe that got severely infected and was turning black. She immediately took a culture and also sent me for blood work and x-rays all of which were in house and the next day the Dr calls me and understanding my extreme need to be with my ill mother she had her staff call north Kansas City hospital to be certain I could check in with top priority I checked in to the hospital 2 hours later and was on IV's for staff and other infections Each and every person that I met at Dr Meseyton office was so very friendly and professional I had gone to other out patient facilities to try to save my toe but the doctor sent me to the NKC burn unit at the hospital and I found out what my prior doctor had stated was completely incorrect even using the wrong ointment for my toe/infection The burn center saved my toe ! Â Throughout many medical issues Dr Meseyton listened to me and I got diagnosed after many years of searching for answers YES there is always a wait to see the doctor BUT I was happy to know that it was most likely because she took her time with her patients as she always did with me. So it was worth it I've now moved out of state but I can tell you I miss Dr Meseyton She's the best, most caring, professional with a heart of gold that I had ever had The best doctor and now seeking one near me I can tell you. I'm missing her more every day lol",5,Clay Platte Family Medicine Clinic,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Pediatricians"

Joni Johnson,"Look somewhere else!All of the doctors that I have seen here have been great and the evening/weekend hours are convenient, but many of the auxiliary supports are a real pain.I have never been called back or seen a doctor at my scheduled appointment time. There has always been at least a 30 minute (and sometimes an hour or more) delay after my appointment time. Prescriptions are often more trouble than they should be. Their automated prescription refill system should make things faster and easier - in theory. But glitches in the system mean that critical prescriptions are sometimes not approved without additional calls to both the clinic and the pharmacy. I don't believe the medical staff is to blame, but this has been a repeated issue for months and the staff has not been informed of a timeline for correction of the issue.Their automated call system is cumbersome and time consuming. Once again, automation might improve service in theory, but does in fact. Today I waited on hold for only a few minutes. This is the exception rather than the rule. Holds on the phone often last for an indeterminate period of time and sometimes the system circles me back around to the beginning without ever speaking to a human.To reiterate a positive point, the doctors and most of the nurses I have seen have been knowledgeable, accommodating, and friendly. But the rest of this clinic's issues make visiting more of a hassle than it's worth.",1,Clay Platte Family Medicine Clinic,"Internal Medicine, Family Practice, Pediatricians"

Jameson Maldonado,"If you want a doctors office who wants you to schedule an office visit to review lab results, a doctor's office that doesn't call back, a doctor's office who will send you to the ER because they can't read a test or are not knowledgeable in a certain medical area, and have very screwed up billing EVERY TIME, then Dr McDonald is the perfect physician for you!! Â I can't count the number of times that it took WEEKS to get them to call back with simple lab results. Â Dr McDonald also sent us to the ER TWICE last year due to misreading an EKG and lack of knowledge of kidney stones. How much do you think that cost us and our health insurance company?My last visit I tried to discuss 8 issues with Dr McDonald as I believe in discussing problems, not hiding from them. After I got through 2 he got very defensive and went off on a tangent that did not allow me to finish my list. Â Not surprisingly I was shipped out the door but surprisingly their office called me to follow up on my visit-only about 3 weeks late! I voiced all my issues to the nurse and asked her to have Dr McDonald personally call me (because on my last visit he said he's ALWAYS available and that he himself will call back if his staff didn't or another doctor wanted to speak to him directly). Â I also told her that I thought there was about a 3% chance that the doctor would call me back due to previous lack of follow up. Â Even after this did I hear from him?? Nope.There is a sign in the lobby that says ""Serving over 30,000 patients."" Â Does that sound like you'll get good service?

Jay-Jay Gregory,"I've been putting off doing this but it's time to get it done. Originally this family practice was good, and my experiences there were positive. I only go to the doctor when I really need to and generally put it off until it gets to that point. But things have steadily degraded over time and I can no longer recommend it. My last two visits were pretty bad, to be honest. I went in primarily to get a referral to a dermatologist a couple of weeks ago but was also starting to experience another lapse with my back (that has since become far worse than when I visited the office). The place was overfilled as has typically been the case lately. The doctor came in, and I will quote what he said when he looked at the things I wanted to talk about ""c'mon guys are you kidding me? I only have 15 minutes per patient."" He was being serious. This was not jokey. I went in primarily to get a referral for a dermatologist and was told they would call me in a few days with a name. No call back. Just ... nothing. The time before last I went in for blood work which came back flagged for something so I went back to have it re-drawn. Was told they would call in a few days with the results. Nothing. No call. I guess I must be healthy then? Who knows. On each of my visits for the past couple of years I have experienced very long wait times. The last one I was asked to come back an hour after my appointment. They have just become too busy and can no longer take time with their patients. Apparently they are too busy to actually take the time to treat them too.

If that weren't enough, for certain providers, follow up on test results and questions are non existent.

Akash Wooten,"I have been to this place quite a few times because it is so close to my house, but I typically wait two hours just to see the doctor. On a good day I waited an hour and that was early in the morning!!! It is awful. The waiting room is also open--there is no separation between the sick and well waiting, so if you have a little kid it is very inconvenient to be around a whole bunch of really sick people. My baby was crying and a nurse gave me a really rude look as if I was being a bad parent because she let out a little cry (after we had been waiting over an hour). The pediatrician, Dr. McDonald, is very nice once he gets in the room, but is it worth the wait, being around a bunch of sick people, or judgmental looks from the staff? I do not think so.

Giles Bullock,"If I could give negative stars I would. My experience with this group of doctors happened in 2002 but I am fairly new to yelp and will use this opportunity to tell a short story. they treated my husband like crap. He was having trouble at working with shortness of breath and weakness. They looked at him and sent him back to work. When he had to return for an office visit for the same reason they told him there was nothing wrong with him and he just needed to go back to work. All along they knew he was a heart patient and had mitral valve prolapse. I suggested he visit his heart Dr and guess what? he had severe leakage of his mitral valve and ended up having heart surgery to correct the problem. NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM!? Wouldn't even see him when he went back and had the snotty secretary tell him he just needed to go back to work!?? Wait it gets better. I went to see them with a head cold after this and before his surgery and told the Dr that saw me what was going on. In a nice polite way I said how they messed up and missed the boat and my husband whom there was nothing wrong with was going to have heart surgery. Well, the next day my husband gets a phone call from a nurse telling him how he needs to come pick up his antibiotics for his dental procedure. He let them know he was having heart surgery not a dental procedure and that if he needed antibiotics his heart doctor would take care of getting them for him. What a joke!

Deen Gallagher,"The only person I have visited at this clinic that I liked was Pam Kepus. Â I love Pam. Â She is a very talented nurse practitioner, and she is very thoughtful, helpful, and she truly listens. Â She also actually has a bedside manner, which many doctors today lack. Â She always shakes my hand and makes me feel like a person, not a symptom. Â There are two people I do not like at this clinic, which includes Danielle Keith and Dr. James McDonald. Â The main reason I didn't like them is because, before they even really talked to me, they did about 5 or 6 tests to see what was up with me. Â I don't even think that is appropriate, and all of this ends up costing me more money because my insurance doesn't fully cover all tests. Â It's also always ended up being a big waste of time. Â I wish they would just check me out fully before jumping on the test bandwagon. Â Also, Dr. McDonald prescribed medicine to me that caused a problem with my illness to get even worse, because it had a side effect that I was experiencing with my illness as well, so I am definitely avoiding him in the future. Â Pam Kepus was the real gem here. Â There are only two other practitioners I've went to in my lifetime that I could say were close to as good as she is, and I'm a tough customer because I want to be paying for quality, not quantity (as in the quantity of tests I always have to take with everyone else...). Â NOTE: Â I recently edited this as of 12/24/2012, and Pam Kepus has left to go to practice at Mosaic Life Care in Parkville.
